INTRODUCTION 


There is a Need 

Does school prepare children for the real world? “Study hard and get good grades and you will 
find a high-paying job with great benefits,” my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to 
provide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest 
chance for success in life. When I finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, 
and near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had 
realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the 
“Master Plan,” I was hired by a “Big 8” accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career 
and retirement at an early age. 

My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hardworking families, of 
modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it 
twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious 
Washington, D.C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career 
path well-defined and early retirement guaranteed. 

Although we have been successful in our careers, they have not turned out quite as we 
expected. We both have changed positions several times-for all the right reasons-but there are 
no pension plans vesting on our behalf. Our retirement funds are growing only through our 
individual contributions. 

Michael and I have a wonderful marriage with three great children. As I write this, two are in 
college and one is just beginning high school. We have spent a fortune making sure our children 
have received the best education available. 

One day in 1996, one of my children came home disillusioned with school. He was bored and 
tired of studying. “Why should I put time into studying subjects I will never use in real life?” he 
protested. 

Without thinking, I responded, “Because if you don’t get good grades, you won’t get into 
college.” “Regardless of whether 1 go to college,” he replied, “I’m going to be rich.” 

“If you don’t graduate from college, you won’t get a good job,” I responded with a tinge of panic 
and motherly concern. “And if you don’t have a good job, how do you plan to get rich?” 

My son smirked and slowly shook his head with mild boredom. We have had this talk many 
times before. He lowered his head and rolled his eyes. My words of motherly wisdom were 
falling on deaf ears once again. 

Though smart and strong-willed, he has always been a polite and respectful young man. 

“Mom,” he began. It was my turn to be lectured. “Get with the times! Look around; the richest 
people didn’t get rich because of their educations. Look at Michael Jordan and Madonna. Even 
Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft; he is now the richest man in

America, and he’s still in his 30s. There is a baseball pitcher who makes more than $4 million a 
year even though he has been labeled ‘mentally challenged.’ ” 

There was a long silence between us. It was dawning on me that 1 was giving my son the same 
advice my parents had given me. The world around us has changed, but the advice hasn’t. 

Getting a good education and making good grades no longer ensures success, and nobody 
seems to have noticed, except our children. 

“Mom,” he continued, “I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of 
money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I'll wind up like you, 
working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security 
anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today 
earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much 
money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for 
retirement. I need new answers.” 

He was right. He needed new answers, and so did I. My parents’ advice may have worked for 
people born before 1945, but it may be disastrous for those of us born into a rapidly changing 
world. No longer can I simply say to my children, 

“Go to school, get good grades, and look for a safe, secure job.” 

I knew I had to look for new ways to guide my children’s education. 

As a mother as well as an accountant, I have been concerned by the lack of financial education 
our children receive in school. Many of today’s youth have credit cards before they leave high 
school, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how 
compound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the 
knowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a 
world in which spending is emphasized over savings. 

When my oldest son became hopelessly in debt with his credit cards as a freshman in college, I 
not only helped him destroy the credit cards, but I also went in search of a program that would 
help me educate my children on financial matters. 

One day last year, my husband called me from his office. “I have someone I think you should 
meet,” he said. “His name is Robert Kiyosaki. He’s a businessman and investor, and he is here 
applying for a patent on an educational product. I think it’s what you have been looking for.” 

Just What I Was Looking For 

My husband, Mike, was so impressed with CASHFLOW, the new educational product that 
Robert Kiyosaki was developing, that he arranged for both of us to participate in a test of the 
prototype. Because it was an educational game, I also asked my 19-year-old daughter, who was 
a freshman at a local university, if she would like to take part, and she agreed. 

About fifteen people, broken into three groups, participated in the test. 

Mike was right. It was the educational product I had been looking for. But it had a twist: It

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


looked like a colorful Monopoly board with a giant well-dressed rat in the middle. Unlike 
Monopoly, however, there were two tracks: one inside and one outside. The object of the game 
was to get out of the inside track-what Robert called the “Rat Race” and reach the outer track, 
or the “Fast Track.” As Robert put it, the Fast Track simulates how rich people play in real life. 

Robert then defined the “Rat Race” for us. 

"If you look at the life of the average -educated, hard-working person, there is a similar path. The 
child is born and goes to school. The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets 
fair to good grades, and is accepted into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to 
graduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career. 
The child finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for the 
government. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to arrive in mass, and 
the shopping begins, if it already hasn’t. 

"Having money to burn, the child goes to places where other young people just like them hang 
out, and they meet people, they date, and sometimes they get married. Life is wonderful now, 
because today, both men and women work. Two incomes are bliss. They feel successful, their 
future is bright, and they decide to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have 
children. The happy bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple 
decides that their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions 
and raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger house. They 
work harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go back to school to get 
more specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe they take a second job. Their 
incomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they’re in and the real estate taxes on their new 
large home, and their Social Security taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large 
paycheck and wonder where all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy 
groceries with their credit card. The children reach 5 or 6 years of age, and the need to save for 
college increases as well as the need to save for their retirement. . 

"That happy couple, born 35 years ago, is now trapped in the Rat Race for the rest of their 
working days. They work for the owners of their company, for the government paying taxes, 
and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. 

“Then, they advise their own children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or 
career.’ They learn nothing about money, except from those who profit from their naivete, and 
work hard all their lives. The process repeats into another hard-working generation. This is the 
‘Rat Race’.” 

The only way to get out of the “Rat Race” is to prove your proficiency at both accounting and 
investing, arguably two of the most difficult subjects to master. As a trained CPA who once 
worked for a Big 8 accounting firm, I was surprised that Robert had made the learning of these 
two subjects both fun and exciting. The process was so well disguised that while we were 
diligently working to get out of the “Rat Race,” we quickly forgot we were learning. 

Soon a product test turned into a fun afternoon with my daughter, talking about things we had 
never discussed before. As an accountant, playing a game that required an Income Statement 
and Balance Sheet was easy. So I had the time to help my daughter and the other players at my 


Page 4/114

table with concepts they did not understand. I was the first person-and the only person in the 
entire test group-to get out of the “Rat Race” that day. I was out within 50 minutes, although 
the game went on for nearly three hours. 

At my table was a banker, a business owner and a computer programmer. What greatly 
disturbed me was how little these people knew about either accounting or investing, subjects so 
important in their lives. I wondered how they managed their own financial affairs in real life. I 
could understand why my 19-year-old daughter would not understand, but these were grown 
adults, at least twice her age. 

After I was out of the “Rat Race,” for the next two hours I watched my daughter and these 
educated, affluent adults roll the dice and move their markers. Although I was glad they were all 
learning so much, I was disturbed by how much the adults did not know about the basics of 
simple accounting and investing. They had difficulty grasping the relationship between their 
Income Statement and their Balance Sheet. As they bought and sold assets, they had trouble 
remembering that each transaction could impact their monthly cash flow. I thought, how many 
millions of people are out there in the real world struggling financially, only because they have 
never been taught these subjects? 

Thank goodness they’re having fun and are distracted by the desire to win the game, I said to 
myself. After Robert ended the contest, he allowed us fifteen minutes to discuss and critique 
CASHFLOW among ourselves. 

The business owner at my table was not happy. He did not like the game. "I don’t need to know 
this,” he said out loud. “I hire accountants, bankers and attorneys to tell me about this stuff.” 

To which Robert replied, “Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of accountants who aren’t 
rich? And bankers, and attorneys, and stockbrokers and real estate brokers. They know a lot, 
and for the most part are smart people, but most of them are not rich. Since our schools do not 
teach people what the rich know, we take advice from these people. But one day, you’re 
driving down the highway, stuck in traffic, struggling to get to work, and you look over to your 
right and you see your accountant stuck in the same traffic jam. You look to your left and you 
see your banker. That should tell you something.” 

The computer programmer was also unimpressed by the game: “I can buy software to teach me 
this.” 

The banker, however, was moved. “I studied this in school-the accounting part, that is-but I 
never knew how to apply it to real life. Now I know. I need to get myself out of the ‘Rat Race.’ ” 

But it was my daughter’s comments that most touched me. “I had fun learning,” she said. “I 
learned a lot about how money really works and how to invest.” 

Then she added: “Now I know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not 
because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what this game teaches, I’m 
free to do and study what my heart wants to study. . .rather than study something because 
businesses are looking for certain job skills. If I learn this, I won’t have to worry about job 
security and Social Security the way most of my classmates already do.”

I was not able to stay and talk with Robert after we had played the game, but we agreed to meet 
later to further discuss his project. I knew he wanted to use the game to help others become 
more financially sawy, and I was eager to hear more about his plans. 

My husband and I set up a dinner meeting with Robert and his wife within the next week. 
Although it was our first social get-together, we felt as if we had known each other for years. 

We found out we had a lot in common. We covered the gamut, from sports and plays to 
restaurants and socio-economic issues. We talked about the changing world. We spent a lot of 
time discussing how most Americans have little or nothing saved for retirement, as well as the 
almost bankrupt state of Social Security and Medicare. Would my children be required to pay for 
the retirement of 75 million baby boomers? We wondered if people realize how risky it is to 
depend on a pension plan. 

Robert’s primary concern was the growing gap between the haves and have nots, in America 
and around the world. A self-taught, self-made entrepreneur who traveled the world putting 
investments together, Robert was able to retire at the age of 47. He came out of retirement 
because he shares the same concern I have for my own children. He knows that the world has 
changed, but education has not changed with it. According to Robert, children spend years in an 
antiquated educational system, studying subjects they will never use, preparing for a world that 
no longer exists. 

“Today, the most dangerous advice you can give a child is ‘Go to school, get good grades and 
look for a safe secure job,’ ” he likes to say. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could 
see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.” 

It’s bad advice, he believes, “because if you want your child to have a financially secure future, 
they can’t play by the old set of rules. It’s just too risky.” 

I asked him what he meant by “old rules?” . 

“People like me play by a different set of rules from what you play by,” he said. “What happens 
when a corporation announces a downsizing?” 

“People get laid off,” I said. "Families are hurt. Unemployment goes 

M 

up. 

“Yes, but what happens to the company, in particular a public company on the stock 
exchange?” 

“The price of the stock usually goes up when the downsizing is announced,” I said. “The market 
likes it when a company reduces its labor costs, either through automation or just consolidating 
the labor force in general.” 

“That’s right,” he said. “And when stock prices go up, people like me, the shareholders, get 
richer. That is what I mean by a different set of rules. Employees lose; owners and investors 
win.” 

Robert was describing not only the difference between an employee and employer, but also the 


Page 6/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


difference between controlling your own destiny and giving up that control to someone else. 

“But it’s hard for most people to understand why that happens,” I said. “They just think it’s not 
fair.” 

“That’s why it is foolish to simply say to a child, ‘Get a good education,’ ” he said. “It is foolish 
to assume that the education the school system provides will prepare your children for the world 
they will face upon graduation. Each child needs more education. Different education. And they 
need to know the rules. The different sets of rules.” 

“There are rules of money that the rich play by, and there are the rules that the other 95 
percent of the population plays by,” he said. “And the 95 percent learns those rules at home 
and in school. That is why it’s risky today to simply say to a child, ‘Study hard and look for a job.’ 
A child today needs a more sophisticated education, and the current system is not delivering the 
goods. I don’t care how many computers they put in the classroom or how much money schools 
spend. How can the education system teach a subject that it does not know?” 

So how does a parent teach their children, what the school does not? How do you teach 
accounting to a child? Won’t they get bored? And how do you teach investing when as a parent 
you yourself are risk averse? Instead of teaching my children to simply play it safe, I decided it 
was best to teach them to play it smart. 

“So how would you teach a child about money and all the things we’ve talked about?” I asked 
Robert. “How can we make it easy for parents especially when they don’t understand it 
themselves?” 

“I wrote a book on the subject, ” he said. 

“Where is it?” 

“In my computer. It’s been there for years in random pieces. I add to it occasionally but I’ve 
never gotten around to put it all together. I began writing it after my other book became a best 
seller, but I never finished the new one. It’s in pieces.” 

And in pieces it was. After reading the scattered sections, I decided the book had merit and 
needed to be shared, especially in these changing times. We agreed to co-author Robert’s book. 

I asked him how much financial information he thought a child needed. He said it would depend 
on the child. He knew at a young age that he wanted to be rich and was fortunate enough to 
have a father figure who was rich and willing to guide him. Education is the foundation of 
success, Robert said. Just as scholastic skills are vitally important, so are financial skills and 
communication skills. 

What follows is the story of Robert’s two dads, a rich one and a poor 

one, that expounds on the skills he’s developed over a lifetime. The contrast between two dads 
provides an important perspective. The book is supported, edited and assembled by me. For 
any accountants who read this book, suspend your academic book knowledge and open your 
mind to the theories Robert presents. Although many of them challenge the very fundamentals 
of generally accepted accounting principles, they provide a valuable insight into the way true

investors analyze their investment decisions. 

When we as parents advise our children to “go to school, study hard and get a good job,” we 
often do that out of cultural habit. It has always been the right thing to do. When I met Robert, 
his ideas initially startled me. Having been raised by two fathers, he had been taught to strive for 
two different goals. His educated dad advised him to work for a corporation. His rich dad 
advised him to own the corporation. Both life paths required education, but the subjects of study 
were completely different. His educated dad encouraged Robert to be a smart person. His rich 
dad encouraged Robert to know how to hire smart people. 

Having two dads caused many problems. Robert’s real dad was the superintendent of education 
for the state of Hawaii. By the time Robert was 16, the threat of “If you don’t get good grades, 
you won’t get a good job” had little effect. He already knew his career path was to own 
corporations, not to work for them. In fact, if it had not been for a wise and persistent high 
school guidance counselor, Robert might not have gone on to college. He admits that. He was 
eager to start building his assets, but finally agreed that the college education would also be a 
benefit to him. 

Truthfully, the ideas in this book are probably too far fetched and radical for most parents today. 
Some parents are having a hard enough time simply keeping their children in school. But in 
light of our changing times, as parents we need to be open to new and bold ideas. To 
encourage children to be employees is to advise your children to pay more than their fair share 
of taxes over a lifetime, with little or no promise of a pension. And it is true that taxes are a 
person’s greatest expense. In fact, most families work from January to mid-May for the 
government just to cover their taxes. New ideas are needed and this book provides them. 

Robert claims that the rich teach their children differently. They teach their children at home, 
around the dinner table. These ideas may notbe the ideas you choose to discuss with your 
children, but thank you for looking at them. And I advise you to keep searching. In my opinion, 
as a mom and a CPA, the concept of simply getting good grades and finding a good job is an old 
idea. We need to advise our children with a greater degree of sophistication. We need new 
ideas and different education. Maybe telling our children to strive to be good employees while 
also striving to own their own investment corporation is not such a bad idea. 

It is my hope as a mother that this book helps other parents. It is Robert’s hope to inform 
people that anyone can achieve prosperity if they choose so. If today you are a gardener or a 
janitor or even unemployed, you have the ability to educate yourself and teach those you love to 
take care of themselves financially. Remember that financial intelligence is the mental process 
via which we solve our financial problems. 

Today we are facing global and technological changes as great or even greater than those ever 
faced before. No one has a crystal ball, but one thing is for certain: Changes lie ahead that are 
beyond our reality. Who knows what the future brings? But whatever happens, we have two 
fundamental choices: play it safe or play it smart by preparing, getting educated and awakening 
your own and your children’s financial genius. - Sharon Lechter

CHAPTER ONE 


Rich Dad, Poor Dad 
As narrated by Robert Kiyosaki 

I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent; he had a 
Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on 
to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his 
advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth 
grade . 

Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial 
incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become one of the richest 
men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. 
The other left bills to be paid. 

Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did 
not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the 
same course of study. 

If 1 had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads 
advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man and one of a 
poor man. 

Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, 
comparing and then choosing for myself. 

The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were just 
starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had 
very different points of view about the subject of money. 

For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The other, “The 
lack of money is the root of all evil.” 

As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a 
good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points 
of view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and 
intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying. 

Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, “Why does he 
say that?” and then asking the same question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been 
much easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of 
view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads 
whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a 
process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run, rather than 
simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.

One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in 
debt is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about 
money from our parents. So what can a poor parent tell their child about money? They simply 
say “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades but with a 
poor person’s financial programming and mind-set. It was learned while the child was young. 

Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on 
financial skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent 
grades in school may still struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due 
in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions 
with little or no training on the subject of money. 

I often look ahead to the new millennium and wonder what will happen when we have millions 
of people who will need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent on their 
families or the government for financial support. What will happen when Medicare and Social 
Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues 
to be left to parents-most of whom will be, or already are, poor? 

Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each 
dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s 
thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other 
dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, “How can I afford it?” One is a 
statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to 
think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can’t 
afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is 
put to work. He did not mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising 
your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. “My brain gets stronger every day because 
I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically 
saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness. 

Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep 
when it came to money matters, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long- 
term result was that one dad grew stronger financially and the other grew weaker. It is not much 
different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who 
sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for 
health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. Laziness decreases both 
health and wealth. 

My two dads had opposing attitudes in thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more 
in taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce 
and reward those who don’t produce.” 

One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to work for.” The other 
recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to buy.” One dad said, “The 
reason I’m not rich is because 1 have you kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is 
because I have you kids.” One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table. 
The other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. One said, “When it comes 


Page 11/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


to money, play it safe, don’t take risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.” 

One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset.” The other believed, 
“My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.” 

Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other paid his bills last. 

One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and your needs. He was 
always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days 
and other perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a 
retirement and entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the 
idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also loved the 
tenure system available through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job 
benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard 
for the government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.” 

The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the “entitlement” 
mentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about 
being financially competent. 

One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other simply created investments. 

One dad taught me how to write an impressive resume so I could find a good job. The other 
taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could create jobs. 

Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the effects different 
thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really do shape their life through their 
thoughts. 

For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that prophesy became reality. 
My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, 
“I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major 
financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by 
saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. - Broke is temporary, and 
poor is eternal.” 

My poor dad would also say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money doesn’t matter.” My rich 
dad always said, “Money is power.” 

The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me 
as a young boy to be aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor 
dad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but 
because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy, having two fathers, I became acutely 
aware of being careful which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Whom should I listen to-my 
rich dad or my poor dad? 

Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed in what 
they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree and get a 
good job to work for money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or 
an accountant or to go to business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to study to be

rich, to understand how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work for 
money!” were words he would repeat over and over, “Money works for me!” 

At the age of 9, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I 
chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees. 

A Lesson From Robert Frost 

Robert Frost is my favourite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my favorite is The Road 
Not Taken. I use its lesson almost daily: 

The Road Not Taken 

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both. And be one traveler, 
long I stood. And looked down one as far as I could. To where it bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took the other, as just as fair. And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy 
and wanted wear. Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, 

And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for 
another day! Yet knowing how way leads onto way, I doubted if I should ever come back. 

I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two roads diverged in a 
wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. 

Robert Frost(1916) 

And that made all the difference. 

Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem. Choosing not to listen to my 
highly educated dad’s advice and attitude about money was a painful decision, but it was a 
decision that shaped the rest of my life. 

Once I made up my mind whom to listen to, my education about money began. My rich dad 
taught me over a period of 30 years, until I was age 39. He stopped once he realized that I 
knew and fully understood what he had been trying to drum into my often thick skull. 

Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes 
and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and 
can begin building wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most 
people went to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working 
for money. 

Because I was only 9 years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad taught me were simple. 
And when it was all said and done, there were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. 
This book is about those six lessons, put as simply as possible as my rich dad put forth those 
lessons to me. The lessons are not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will 
assist you and your children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing 
change and uncertainty.

CHAPTER TWO 


Lesson One: The Rich Don’t Work For Money 
“Dad, Can You Tell Me How to Get Rich?” 

My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get rich, son?” 

“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they were going to their 
beach house for the weekend. He took three of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They 
told us we weren’t invited because we were ‘poor kids’.” 

“They did?” my dad asked incredulously. 

“Yeah, they did.” I replied in a hurt tone. 

My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and went back to 
reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer. 

The year was 1956. 1 was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, 1 attended the same public school 
where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers 
of the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, 
and bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were 
generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went to 
this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would have gone to a different school, 
with kids from families more like mine. After grade 6, these kids and I would go on to the public 
intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for me. 

My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking. 

“Well, son,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have to learn to make money.” 

“How do I make money?” I asked. 

“Well, use your head, son,” he said, smiling. Which really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell 
you,” or “1 don’t know the answer, so don’t embarrass me.” 

A Partnership Is Formed 

The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said. As best I could tell, Mike 
and I were the only poor kids in this school. Mike was like me in that he was in this school by a 
twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in 
school with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other 
boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything. 

Mom and dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, clothes. :, But that was about it. My 
dad used to say, “If you want something, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not 
much work available for 9- , year-old boys.

“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?” 

He agreed and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first business partner. We spent 
all morning coming up with ideas on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the 
“cool guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it 
inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning 
came through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he had read. 
Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business. 

For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, knocking on doors and 
asking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most 
adults consented with a smile. Some asked us what we were doing. To which we replied, “We 
can’t tell you. It’s a business secret.” 

My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site next to her washing 
machine as the place we would stockpile our raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that one 
time held catsup bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow. 

Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ messy, crumpled used 
toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you boys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to 
hear again that it’s a business secret. Do something with this mess or I’m going to throw it out.” 

Mike and 1 pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have enough and then we would 
begin production. We informed her that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish 
using up their toothpaste so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension. 

The date to begin production was moved up. The pressure was on. My first partnership was 
already being threatened with an eviction notice from our warehouse space by my own mom. It 
became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist 
wanted them to brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line. 

One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two 9-year-old boys in the driveway with a 
production line operating at full speed. There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long 
table were small milk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing with red hot 
coals at maximum heat. 

Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the driveway, since the 
production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting 
on top of the coals, with the toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did 
not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, the 
tubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, and with my mom’s 
pot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons. 

The milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris. The white powder everywhere was the plaster 
before we mixed it with water. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the entire area 
look like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer containers for plaster- 
of-Paris molds.

My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten lead through a small hole in 
the top of the plaster-of-Paris cube. 

“Careful,” my dad said. 

I nodded without looking up. 

Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down and smiled at my dad. 

“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile. 

“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,” I said. 

“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.” 

“And what is in those plaster molds?” dad asked. 

“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.” 

With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube in 

half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a lead nickel fell out." 

“Oh, my God!” my dad said. “You’re casting nickels out of lead.” 

“That’s right,” Mike said. “We doing as you told us to do. We’re making money.” 

My dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled and shook his head. Along with a 
fire and a box of spent toothpaste tubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white 
dust and smiling from ear to ear. 

He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front step of our house. With a 
smile, he gently explained what the word “counterfeiting” meant. 

Our dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike in a 

quivering voice. 

“Let them go,” my dad’s friend said. “They might be developing a natural talent.” 

My dad glared at him. 

“Yes, it is illegal,” my dad said gently. “But you boys have shown great creativity and original 
thought. Keep going. I’m really proud of you!" 

Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes before we began cleaning up 
our mess. The business was over on opening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike 
and said, “I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.” 

My father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. "You’re only poor if you give up. The 
most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. 
You’ve done something. I'm very proud of the two of you. I will say it again.

Keep going. Don’t quit." 

Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we still did not know what to do. 
“So how come you’re not rich, dad?” I asked. 

“Because I chose to be a school teacher. School teachers really don’t think about being rich. We 
just like to teach. I wish I could help you, but 1 really don’t know how to make money.” 

Mike and I turned and continued our clean up. 

“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be rich, don’t ask me. Talk to your 
dad, Mike.” 

“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched up face. 

“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad and I have the same banker, and he 
raves about your father. He’s told me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to 
making money.” 

“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we don’t have a nice car and a nice 
house like the rich kids at school?” 

“A nice car and a nice house does not necessarily mean you’re rich or you know how to make 
money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for the sugar plantation. He’s not much different 
from me. He works for a company, and I work for the government. The company buys the car 
for him. The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy’s dad may soon have nothing. 
Your dad is different Mike. He seems to be building an empire, and I suspect in a few years he 
will be a very rich man.” 

With that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began cleaning up the mess caused 
by our now defunct first business. As we were cleaning, we made plans on how and when to talk 
to Mike’s dad. The problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not come 
home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction company, a chain of stores, and 
three restaurants. It was the restaurants that kept him out late. 

Mike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He was going to talk to his dad 
when he got home that night and ask him if he would teach us how to become rich. Mike 
promised to call as soon as he had talked to his dad, even if it was late. 

The phone rang at 8:30 p.m. 

“OK,” I said. “Next Saturday.” And put the phone down. Mike’s dad had agreed to meet with 
Mike and me. 

At 7:30 Saturday morning, I caught the bus to the poor side of town. 

The Lessons Begin: 

“I’ll pay you 10 cents an hour. 

Even by 1956 pay standards, 10 cents an hour was low.

Michael and I met with his dad that morning at 8 o’clock. He was already busy and had been at 
work for more than an hour. His construction supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I 
walked up to his simple, small and tidy home. Mike met me at the door. 

“Dad’s on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,” Mike said as he opened the door. 

The old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of this aging house. There was 
a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there to hide the years of wear from countless 
footsteps that the floor had supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced. 

I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room, which was filled with old musty 
overstuffed furniture that today would be collector’s items. Sitting on the couch were two 
women, a little older than my mom. Across from the women sat a man in workman’s clothes. 
He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished work 
books. He was about 10 years older than my dad; I’d say about 45 years old. They smiled as 
Mike and I walked past them, heading for the kitchen, which lead to the porch that overlooked 
the back yard. I smiled back shyly. 

“Who are those people?” I asked. 

“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the women are the 
managers of the restaurants. And you saw the construction supervisor, who is working on a road 
project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had 
already left before you got here.” 

“Does this go on all the time?” I asked. 

“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair to sit down next to me. 

“I asked him if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said. 

“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity. 

“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he would make us an offer.” 
“Oh,” 1 said, rocking my chair back against the wall; I sat there perched on two rear legs of the 
chair. Mike did the same thing. “Do you know what the offer is?” I asked. “No, but we’ll soon 
find out.” Suddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the 

porch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect but because we were startled. 

“Ready boys?” Mike’s dad asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down with us. 

We nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall to sit in front of him. 

He was a big man, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was taller, about the same weight, 
and five years older than Mike’s dad. They sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic 
makeup. Maybe their energy was similar. 

“Mike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?” 

I nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation. He had a lot of power behind his words

and smile . 

“OK, here’s my offer. I’ll teach you, but I won’t do it classroom-style. You work for me, I’ll teach 
you. You don’t work for me, I won’t teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m 
wasting my time if you just want to sit and listen, like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take it 
or leave it.” 

“Ah... may I ask a question first?” I asked. 

“No. Take it or leave it. I’ve got too much work to do to waste my time. If you can’t make up 
you mind decisively, then you’ll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and 
go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have an 
opportunity that you asked for. School is beginning or it’s over in ten seconds,” Mike’s dad said 
with a teasing smile. 

“Take it,” I said. 

“Take it,” said Mike. 

“Good,” said Mike’s dad. “Mrs. Martin will be by in ten minutes. After I’m through with her, you 
ride with her to my superette and you can begin working. I'll pay you 10 cents an hour and you 
will work for three hours every Saturday.” 

“But I have a softball game today,” I said. 

Mike’s dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. “Take it or leave it,” he 
“I’ll take it,” I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing softball. 

30 Cents Later 

By 9 a.m. on a beautiful Saturday morning, Mike and I were working for Mrs. Martin. She was a 
kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I reminded her of her two sons who 
were grown and gone. Although kind, she believed in hard work and she kept us working. She 
was a task master. We spent three hours taking canned goods off the shelves and, with a feather 
duster, brushing each can to get the dust off, and then re-stacking them neatly. It was 
excruciatingly boring work. 

Mike’s dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little superettes with large parking 
lots. They were the early version of the 7-11 convenience stores. Little neighborhood grocery 
stores where people bought items such as milk, bread, butter and cigarettes. The problem was, 
this was Hawaii before air conditioning, and the stores could not close its doors because of the 
heat. On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking lot. 
Every time a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. 

Hence, we had a job for as long as there was no air conditioning. 

For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our three hours. By noon, our 
work was over, and she dropped three little dimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age 
of 9 in the mid-1950s, 30 cents was not too exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back then, so I 
usually spent my money on comic books and went home.

By Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had agreed to work only because I 
wanted to learn to make money from Mike’s dad, and now I was a slave for 10 cents an hour. 
On top of that, 1 had not seen Mike’s dad since that first Saturday. 

“I’m quitting,” I told Mike at lunchtime. The school lunch was miserable. School was boring, and 
now I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was the 30 cents that really got 
to me. 

This time Mike smiled. 

“What are you laughing at?” I asked with anger and frustration. 

“Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were ready to quit.” 

“What?” I said indignantly. “He’s been waiting for me to get fed up?” 

“Sort of,” Mike said. “Dad’s kind of different. He teaches differently from your dad. Your mom 
and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I’ll 
tell him you’re ready.” 

“You mean I’ve been set up?” 

“No, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday.” 

Waiting in Line on Saturday 

I was ready to face him and I was prepared. Even my real dad was angry with him. My real dad, 
the one I call the poor one , thought that my rich dad was violating child labor laws and should be 
investigated. 

My educated poor dad told me to demand what I deserve. At least 25 cents an hour. My poor 
dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit immediately. 

“You don’t need that damned job anyway,” said my poor dad with indignity. At 8 o’clock 
Saturday morning, I was going through the same rickety door of Mike’s house. 

“Take a seat and wait in line,” Mike’s dad said as I entered. He turned and disappeared into his 
little office next to a bedroom. 

I looked around the room and did not see Mike anywhere. Feeling awkward, I cautiously sat 
down next to the same two women who where there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid 
across the couch to make room for me . 

Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had met with him and left 
thirty minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there for twenty minutes and was also gone. 

The house was empty, and I sat out in his musty dark living room on a beautiful sunny Hawaiian 
day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited children. I could hear him rustling around the 
office, talking on the phone, and ignoring me. I was now ready to walk out, but for some reason 
I stayed. 

Finally, fifteen minutes later, at exactly 9 o’clock, rich dad walked out of his office, said nothing, 


Page 21/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


and signaled with his hand for me to enter his dingy office. 

“1 understand you want a raise or you’re going to quit,” rich dad said as he swiveled in his office 
chair. 

“Well, you’re not keeping your end of the bargain,” I blurted out nearly in tears. It was really 
frightening for a 9-year-old boy to confront a grownup. 

“You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I’ve worked for you. I’ve worked 
hard. I’ve given up my baseball games to work for you. And you don’t keep your word. You 
haven’t taught me anything. You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are. You’re 
greedy. You want all the money and don’t take care of your employees. You make me wait and 
don’t show me any respect. I’m only a little boy, and I deserve to be treated better.” 

Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin, somewhat staring at me. It was 
like he was studying me . 

“Not bad,” he said. “In less than a month, you sound like most of my employees.” 

“What?” I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I continued with my grievance. “I 
thought you were going to keep your end of the bargain and teach me. Instead you want to 
torture me? That’s cruel. That’s really cruel.” 

“I am teaching you,” rich dad said quietly. 

“What have you taught me? Nothing!” I said angrily. "You haven’t even talked to me once since 
I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an hour. Hah! I should notify the government about 
you. 

We have child labor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you know." 

“Wow!” said rich dad. “Now you sound just like most of the people who used to work for me. 
People I’ve either fired or they’ve quit.” 

“So what do you have to say?” I demanded, feeling pretty brave for a little kid. “You lied to me. 
I’ve worked for you, and you have not kept your word. You haven’t taught me anything.” 

“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich dad calmly. 

“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks, and you have not taught me 
anything,” I said with a pout. 

“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked. 

“Well, yes,” I replied. 

“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said smiling. “But that is not how life teaches you, 
and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It 
just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you 
to learn.’ ” 

“What is this man talking about?” I asked myself silently. “Life pushing me around was life

talking to me?” Now I knew I had to quit my job. I was talking to someone who needed to be 
locked up. 

“If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. 
People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But 
they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it’s 
life that’s pushing.” 

I had no idea what he was talking about. 

“Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. 
They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to 
learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.” 

Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that needed repair. "If you learn this 
lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy and happy young man. If you don’t, you will spend 
your life blaming a job, low pay or your boss for your problems. You’ll live life hoping for that 
big break that will solve all your money problems.” 

Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes met mine. We stared at each 
other, streams of communication going between us through our eyes. Finally, I pulled away once 
I had absorbed his last message. I knew he was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I 
was fighting. 

Rich dad continued. “Or if you’re the kind of person who has no guts, you just give up every 
time life pushes you. If you’re that kind of person, you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing 
the right things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old 
man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working 
guy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you 
into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the 
fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will 
know you didn’t go for it. You chose to play it safe.” 

Our eyes met again. For ten seconds, we looked at each other, only pulling away once the 
message was received. 

“You’ve been pushing me around” I asked. 

“Some people might say that,” smiled rich dad. "I would say that I just gave you a taste of life.“ 
’’What taste of life?" I asked, still angry, but now curious. Even ready to learn. 

“You boys are the first people that have ever asked me to teach them how to make money. I 
have more than 150 employees, and not one of them has asked me what I know about money. 
They ask me for a job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most will 
spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really understanding what it is they 
are working for.” 

I sat there listening intently.

course that was close to real life. I could talk until I was blue in the face, but you wouldn’t hear a 
thing. So I decided to let life push you around a bit so you could hear me. That’s why I only paid 
you 10 cents.” 

“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an hour?” I asked. “That you’re 
cheap and exploit your workers?” 

Rich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally, after his laughing stopped, he said, “You’d 
best change your point of view. Stop blaming me, thinking I’m the problem. If you think I’m the 
problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can 
change yourself, learn something and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world 
to change but themselves. Let me tell you, it’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said. 

“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient. 

“But you only pay me 10 cents.” 

“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling. 

“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin. 

“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad. 

“But you are.” 

"Well, keep that attitude and you learn nothing. Keep the attitude 
that I'm the problem and what choices do you have?" 

“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and teach me, I’ll quit.” 

“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people do. They quit and go looking for 
another job, better opportunity, and higher pay, actually thinking that a new job or more pay will 
solve the problem. In most cases, it won’t.” 

“So what will solve the problem?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an hour and smile?” 

Rich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do. Just accept a paycheck knowing that they 
and their family will struggle financially. But that’s all they do, waiting for a raise thinking that 
more money will solve the problem. Most just accept it, and some take a second job working 
harder, but again accepting a small paycheck.” 

I sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson rich dad was presenting. I could 
sense it was a taste of life. Finally, I looked up and repeated the question. “So what will solve 
the problem?” 

“This,” he said tapping me gently on the head. “This stuff between your ears.” 

It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of view that separated him from his 
employees and my poor dad-and led him to eventually become one of the richest men in Hawaii

while my highly educated, but poor, dad struggled financially all his life. It was a singular point of 
view that made all the difference over a lifetime. 

Rich dad said over and over, this point of view, which I call Lesson No. 1. 

“The poor and the middle class work for money.” “The rich have money work for them.” 

On that bright Saturday morning, I was learning a completely different point of view from what I 
had been taught by my poor dad. At the age of 9, I grew aware that both dads wanted me to 
learn. Both dads encouraged me to study... but not the same things. 

My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. “Son, I want you to study hard, get 
good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has 
excellent benefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work 
for me. These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom. 

My rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry about working for 10 cents an 
hour. If you had not gotten angry and had gladly accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could 
not teach you. You see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big 
part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most 
people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does.” 

“So is that why they’ll take a job with low par?” 1 asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because I don’t pay as much as the 
sugar plantation or the government. I say the people exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not 
mine . ” 

“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked. 

“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve the problem. Just look at your dad. He 
makes a lot of money, and he still can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get 
into more debt.” 

“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part of the lesson.” 

“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school and got an excellent 
education, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he still has money problems 
because he never learned anything about money at school. On top of that, he believes in 
working for money.” 

“And you don’t?” I asked. 

“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for money, then stay in school. 
That is a great place to learn to do that. But if you want to learn how to have money work for 
you, then I will teach you that. But only if you want to learn.” 

“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that” I asked. 

“No,” said rich dad. “Simply because it’s easier to learn to work for money, especially if fear is 
your primary emotion when the subject of money is discussed.”

“I don’t understand,’’ I said with a frown. 

"Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear that keeps most people working at a 
job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being fired. The fear of not having enough 
money. The fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and 
then working for money. Most people become a slave to money... and then get angry at their 
boss." 

“Learning to have money work for you is a completely different course of study?” I asked. 
“Absolutely,” rich dad answered, “absolutely.” 

We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My friends would have just been 
starting their Little League baseball game. But far some reason, I was now thankful I had 
decided to work for 10 cents an hour. I sensed that 1 was about to learn something my friends 
would not learn in school. 

“Ready to learn?” asked rich dad. 

“Absolutely,” I said with a grin. 

“I have kept my promise. I’ve been teaching you from afar,” my rich dad said. “At 9 years old, 
you've gotten a taste of what it feels like to work for money. Just multiply your last month by 
fifty years and you will have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said. 

“How did you feel waiting in line to see me? Once to get hired and once to ask for more 
money?” 

“Terrible,” I said. 

“If you choose to work for money, that is what life is like for many people,” said rich dad. 

“And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in your hand for three hours’ 
work?” 

“1 felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was disappointed,” I said. 

“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their paychecks. Especially after all the 
tax and other deductions are taken out. At least you got 100 percent.” 

“You mean most workers don’t get paid everything?" I asked with amazement. 

“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its share first.” 

“How do they do that." I asked. 

“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You're taxed when you spend. You’re 
taxed when you save. You’re taxed when you die.” 

“Why do people let the government do that to them?”

“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the middle class do. I’ll bet you that I 
earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in taxes.” 

“How can that be?” I asked. As a 9-year-old boy, that made no sense to me. “Why would 
someone let the government do that to them?” 

Rich dad sat there in silence. I guess he wanted me to listen instead of jabber away at the 
mouth. 

Finally, I calmed down. I did not like what I had heard. I knew my dad complained constantly 
about paying so much in taxes, but really did nothing about it. Was that life pushing him around? 

Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me. 

“Ready to learn?” he asked. 

I nodded my head slowly. 

“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. 
Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends. I already know that my study 
of money will continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I find out, the more I find out 
I need to know. Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, 
balance their checkbooks, and that’s it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money 
problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. Few realize that it’s their 
lack of financial education that is the problem.” 

“So my dad has tax problems because he doesn’t understand money?” I asked, confused. 

“Look,” said rich dad. “Taxes are just one small section on learning how to have money work 
for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about money. Most 
people don’t. They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn 
lots of money. One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can’t stop 
working. That’s the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to 
have money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?” asked rich dad. 

I nodded my head. 

“Good,” said rich dad. “Now get back to work. This time, 1 will pay you nothing.” 

“What?” I asked in amazement. 

"You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours every 

Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour. You said you wanted to learn to 
not work for money, so I’m not going to pay you anything." 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. 

“I’ve already had this conversation with Mike. He’s already working, dusting and stacking canned 
goods for free. You’d better hurry and get back there.” 

“That’s not fair,” I shouted. “You've got to pay something.”

“You said you wanted to learn. If you don’t learn this now, you’ll grow up to be like the two 
women and the older man sitting in my living room, working for money and hoping I don’t fire 
them. Or like your dad, earning lots of money only to be in debt up to his eyeballs, hoping more 
money will solve the problem. If that’s what you want, I’ll go back to our original deal of 10 
cents an hour. Or you can do what most people grow up to do. Complain that there is not 
enough pay, quit and go looking for another job.” 

“But what do 1 do?” I asked. 

Rich dad tapped me on the head. “Use this,” he said. “If you use it well, you will soon thank me 
for giving you an opportunity, and you will grow into a rich man.” 

I stood there still not believing what a raw deal I had been handed. Here I came to ask for a 
raise, and now I was being told to keep working for nothing. 

Rich dad tapped me on the head again and said, “Use this. Now get out of here and get back to 
work.” 

LESSON #1: The Rich Don’t Work For Money 

I didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He would not have understood, and I did not want 
to try to explain something that I did not yet understand myself. 

For three more weeks, Mike and I worked for three hours, every Saturday, for nothing. The 
work didn’t bother me, and the routine got easier. It was the missed baseball games and not 
being able to afford to buy a few comic books that got to me. 

Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his truck pull up in the parking lot 
and sputter when the engine was turned off. He entered the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with 
a hug. After finding out how things were going in the store, he reached into the ice-cream 
freezer, pulled out two bars, paid for them, and signalled to Mike and me. 

“Let’s go for a walk boys.” 

We crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a large grassy field, where a few 
adults were playing softball. Sitting down at a remote picnic table, he handed Mike and me the 
ice-cream bars. 

“How’s it going boys?” 

“OK,” Mike said. 

I nodded in agreement. 

“Learn anything yet?” rich dad asked. 

Mike and I looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders and shook our heads in unison. 
Avoiding One of Life’s Biggest Traps 

“Well, you boys had better start thinking. You’re staring at one of life’s biggest lessons. If you 
learn the lesson, you'll enjoy a life of great freedom and security. If you don’t learn the lesson, 


Page 28/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad

you’ll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of the people playing softball in this park. They work 
very hard, for little money, clinging to the illusion of job security, looking forward to a three- 
week vacation each year and a skimpy pension after forty-five years of work. If that excites you, 
I'll give you a raise to 25 cents an hour.” 

“But these are good hard-working people. Are you making fun of them?” I demanded. 

A smile came over rich dad’s face. 

“Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel. I may sound cruel because I’m 
doing my best to point something out to the two of you. I want to expand your point of view so 
you can see something. Something most people never have the benefit of seeing because their 
vision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in.” 

Mike and I sat there uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel, yet we could sense he was 
desperately wanting us to know something. 

With a smile, rich dad said, “Doesn’t that 25 cents an hour sound good? Doesn’t it make your 
heart beat a little faster.” 

I shook my head “no,” but it really did. Twenty five cents an hour would be big bucks to me. 

“OK, I'll pay you a dollar an hour,” rich dad said, with a sly grin. 

Now my heart was beginning to race. My brain was screaming, 

An 

“Take it. Take it.” I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing. 

“OK, $2 an hour.” 

My little 9-year-old brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956 and being paid $2 an 
hour would have made me the richest kid in the world. I couldn’t imagine earning that kind of 
money. I wanted to say “yes.” I wanted the deal. I could see a new bicycle, new baseball glove, 
and adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash. On top of that, Jimmy and his rich 
friends could never call me poor again. But somehow my mouth stayed silent. 

Maybe my brain had overheated and blown a fuse. But deep down, I badly wanted that $2 an 
hour. 

The ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. The ice-cream stick was empty, and 
under it was a sticky mess of vanilla and chocolate that ants were enjoying. Rich dad was looking 
at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and brains empty. He knew he was testing us, 
and he knew there was a part of our emotions that wanted to take the deal. He knew that each 
human being has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that 
each human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a resolve that 
could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was stronger. He had tested 
thousands of souls in his life. He tested souls every time he interviewed someone for a job. 

“OK, $5 an hour.”

Suddenly there was a silence from inside me. Something had changed. The offer was too big 
and had gotten ridiculous. Not too many grownups in 1956 made more than $5 an hour. The 
temptation disappeared, and a calm set in. Slowly I turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked 
back at me. The part of my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had 
no price took over. There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and 
my soul. I knew Mike had gotten to that point also. 

“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most people have a price. And they have a price because of 
human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to 
work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the 
wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.” 

“What pattern?” I asked. 

“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay bills... Their lives are then 
run forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the 
cycle by also increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.” 

“There is another way?” Mike asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.” 

“And what is that way?” Mike asked. 

“That’s what I hope you boys will find out as you work and study with me. That is why I took 
away all forms of pay.” 

“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard, especially for nothing.” 

“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad. 

“We haven’t been lying.” I said. 

“1 did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth,” rich dad came 
back. 

“The truth about what?” I asked. 

“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it to anyone else. Just yourself.” 

“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, Mrs. Martin, they don’t do 
that?” I asked. 

“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not having money. Instead of 
confronting the fear, they react instead of think. They react emotionally instead of using their 
heads,” rich dad said, tapping us on our heads. “’Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and 
again the emotion of joy and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think.” 

“So their emotions do their thinking,” Mike said. 

“That’s correct,” said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how they feel, they react to

their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they go to work, hoping that money will soothe 
the fear, but it doesn’t. That old fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that 
money will calm their fears, and again it doesn’t. Fear has them in this trap of working, earning 
money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and 
that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all 
night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a 
paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to 
tell the truth about that. 

Money is in control of their emotions and hence their souls." 

Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he said, but really did not 
understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew that I often wondered why grownups 
hurried off to work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that happy, but 
something kept them hurrying off to work. 

Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was talking about, rich dad said, “I 
want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, 
because being rich does not solve the problem.” 

“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised. 

“No, it doesn’t. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer 
desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So 
people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can 
buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for 
more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money 
will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.” 

“Even rich people?” Mike asked. 

“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not 
because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of 
not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. 
They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know 
people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They’re terrified 
of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy 
part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars, 
the high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they 
lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and 
have more money.” 

“So is a poor man happier?” I asked. 

“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being 
attached to money.” 

As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large rubbish can and 
rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with great interest, when before we 


Page 31/114

probably would have just ignored him. 

Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man. Seeing the money, the 
derelict came over immediately, took the bill, thanked rich dad profusely and hurried off ecstatic 
with his good fortune. 

“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich dad. “I’ve met so many people 
who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. 
That’s a denial of truth. If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? That 
kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.” 

As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind was flashing back to the countless times my own 
dad said, “I’m not interested in money.” He said those words often. He also covered himself by 
always saying, "I work because I love my job.” 

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not work for money until all traces of fear and greed are gone?” 

“No, that would be a waste of time,” said rich dad. “Emotions are what make us human. Make 
us real. The word ‘emotion’ stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and 
use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.” 

“Whoa!” said Mike. 

“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to come, just be an 
observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that 
are doing the thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your 
own thinking.” 

“Can you give me an example?” I asked. 

“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find a job,’ it’s most likely an emotion 
doing the thinking. Fear of not having money generates that thought.” 

“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said. 

“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that is all too often doing the 
thinking.” “I don’t understand,” said Mike. “For example,” said rich dad. "If the fear of not 
having enough money 

arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job so they can earn a few bucks to kill the 
fear, they instead might ask themselves this question. ‘Will a job be the best solution to this fear 
over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is ‘no.’ Especially when you look over a person’s 
lifetime. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem." 

"But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure 
job.’ I spoke out, somewhat confused. 

“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people recommend that, and it’s 
a good idea for most people. But people make that recommendation primarily out of fear.” 

“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?” 


Page 32/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t be able to earn money and won’t fit into 
society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is 
justified. An education and a job are important. But it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same 
fear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to 
be so fanatical about you going to school.” 

“So what do you recommend?” I asked. 

“I want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. And they don’t teach 
that in school. If you don’t learn it, you become a slave to money.” 

It was finally making sense. He did want us to widen our views. To . see what Mrs. Martin could 
not see, his employees could not see, or my dad for that matter. He used examples that 
sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten them. My vision widened that day, and I 
could begin to see the trap that lay ahead for most people. 

“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels,” said rich dad. “I just 
want you boys to have a chance to avoid the trap. The trap caused by those two emotions, fear 
and desire. Use them in your favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not 
interested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t handle the fear or desire. If 
you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a high-paid slave.” 

“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked. 

“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the 
government or the rich. It’s self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you 
boys go to school and get your college degrees. I’ll teach you how to stay out of the trap.” 

The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a great education and a 
great career. But school never told him how to handle money or his fears. It became clear that I 
could learn different and important things from two fathers. 

“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the desire of money 
affect our thinking?” Mike asked. 

“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice your desires rising?” 

We nodded our heads. 

“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is 
most important. We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most 
important for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not 
simply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed 
against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, 
pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning 
where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of a donkey, 
dragging a cart, with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of the donkey’s nose. The donkey’s 
owner may be going where he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow 
there will only be another carrot for the donkey.”

“You mean the moment I began to picture a new baseball glove, candy and toys, that’s like a 
carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked. 

“Yeah. And as you get older, your toys get more expensive. A new car, a boat and a big house 
to impress your friends,” said rich dad with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire 
calls to you. Enticing you toward the rocks. That’s the trap.” 

“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked. 

“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people with lots of money often 
have more fear the richer they get. Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the 
whole picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.” 

Rich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle between ignorance and 
illumination. 

He explained that once a person stops searching for information and knowledge of one’s self, 
ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment decision-to learn to open or close one’s 
mind. 

“Look, school is very, very important. You go to school to learn a skill or profession so as to be 
a contributing member of society. Every culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, 
cooks, business people, police officers, firefighters, soldiers. Schools train them so our culture 
can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people, school is the end, not 
the beginning.” 

There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I did not comprehend everything he said that 
day. But as with most great teachers, whose words continue to teach for years, often long after 
they’re gone, his words are still with me today. 

“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. "Cruel for a reason. I want you to always remember 
this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. 

I want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two emotions, fear and 
desire, can lead you into life’s biggest trap, if you’re not aware of them controlling your thinking. 
To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, 
thinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in 
the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated 
by the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying 
to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I’ve seen how 
money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life." 

A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw it back. 

“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked. 

“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much fear,” said rich 
dad. "Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting more money to better provide for his 
family, raises his fees. By raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone. 
Now, it hurts the poor people the most, so poor people have worse health than those with

money. 

"Because the doctors raise their rates, the attorneys raise their rates. Because the attorneys’ 
rates have gone up, school teachers want a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. 
Soon, there will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break 
out and another great civilization will collapse. Great civilizations collapsed when the gap 
between the haves and havenots was too great. America is on the same course, proving once 
again that history repeats itself, because we do not learn from history. We only memorize 
historical dates and names, not the lesson. 

“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked. 

“Not in an educated society with a well-run government. Prices should actually come down. Of 
course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by 
ignorance. If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower prices, 
but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money’s 
power.” 

“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “Aren’t you encouraging me to go to 
business school for my master’s degree?” 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated 
bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the 
numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think 
about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is 
important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad 
angrily. 

“So is there an answer?” asked Mike. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions. When 
you boys mastered your emotions, first by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. 
When you again resisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you were again 
learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged. That’s the first step.” 

“Why is that step so important” I asked. 

“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take you boys into the briar patch. 
That place where almost everyone else avoids. I’ll take you to that place where most people are 
afraid to go. If you go with me, you'll let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn 
to have money work for you. " 

“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to learn from you? What will we 
get?” I asked. “The same thing Briar Rabbit got,” said rich dad. “Freedom from the Tar Baby.” 

“Is there a briar patch?” I asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and our greed. Going into our fear and 
confronting our greed, our weaknesses, our neediness is the way out. And the way out is 
through the mind, by choosing our thoughts.”

“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled. 

“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. Instead of just getting up 
and going to work to solve your problems, just because the fear of not having the money to pay 
your bills is scaring you. Thinking would be taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question 
like, ‘Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are so terrified at 
not telling themselves the truth-that fear is in control-that they cannot think, and instead run out 
the door. Tar baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing your thoughts.” 

“And how do we do that?” Mike asked. 

"That’s what I will be teaching you. I’ll be teaching you to have a choice of thoughts to consider, 
rather than knee-jerk reacting, like gulping down your morning coffee and running out the door. 

“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most 
people have only one problem in mind, and it’s short term. It’s the bills at the end of the month, 
the Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money. 
So they do as their parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time 
to say, ‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.” 

“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking?” Mike asked. 

“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like, ‘Well, everyone has to work.’ 
Or The rich are crooks.’ Or ‘I’ll get another job. I deserve this raise. You can’t push me 
around.’ Or ‘I like this job because it’s secure.’ Instead of, ‘Is there something I’m missing here?’ 
which breaks the emotional thought, and gives you time to think clearly.” 

I must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone was speaking out of 
emotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that served me well for life. Especially when I 
was the one speaking out of reaction and not from clear thought. 

As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really did “make money.” They 
did not work for it. He went on to explain that when Mike and I were casting 5-cent pieces out 
of lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think. 
The problem was that it was illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to 
do it, but not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways. 

Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for 
the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions 
of people thinking that money is real. Money is really made up. It was only because of the 
illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that the house of cards stood standing. 
“In fact,” he said, “in many ways the donkey’s carrot was more valuable than money.” 

He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each dollar bill was actually a 
silver certificate. What concerned him was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold 
standard and our dollars would no longer be silver certificates. 

“When that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose. The poor, the middle class and the 
ignorant will have their lives ruined simply because they will continue to believe that money is 


Page 36/114

real and that the company they work for, or the government, will look after them.” 

We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but over the years it made more and 
more sense. 

Seeing What Others Miss 

As he climbed into his pickup truck, outside of his little convenience store, he said, “Keep 
working boys, but the sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will 
be. Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making 
money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. 
Opportunities right in front of their noses. Most people never see these opportunities because 
they’re looking for money and security, so that’s all they get. The moment you see one 
opportunity, you will see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you 
something else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps. You'll never, ever, touch 
that Tar Baby.” 

Mike and I picked up our things from the store and waved goodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went 
back to the park, to the same picnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking. 

We spent the next week at school, thinking and talking. For two more weeks, we kept thinking, 
talking, and working for free. 

At the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye to Mrs. Martin and looking at the 
comic-book stand with a longing gaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every 
Saturday was that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as Mrs. Martin was 
saying goodbye to Mike and me, I saw something she was doing that I had never seen her do 
before. I mean, I had seen her do it, but I never took notice of it. 

Mrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. She was keeping the top half 
of the comic book cover and throwing the rest of the comic book into a large brown cardboard 
box. When I asked her what she did with the comic books, she said, “I throw them away. I give 
the top half of the cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings in the new 
comics. He’s coming in an hour.” 

Mike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived and I asked him if we could have the 
comic books. To which he replied, “You can have them if you work for this store and do not 
resell them.” 

Our partnership was revived. Mike’s mom had a spare room in the basement that no one used. 
We cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in that room. Soon our comic- 
book library was open to the public. We hired Mike’s younger sister, who loved to study, to be 
head librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library, which was open from 
2:30 to 4:30 p.m. every day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood, 
could read as many comics as they could in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a comic 
costs 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours. 

Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left, to make sure they weren’t borrowing any comic 
books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, 


Page 37/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


and any comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week over a three month 
period. We paid his sister $1 a week and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she 
rarely did since she was always studying. 

Mike and F kept our agreement by working in the store every Saturday and collecting all the 
comic books from the different stores. We kept our agreement to the distributor by not selling 
any comic books. We burned them once they got too tattered. We tried opening a branch 
office, but we could never quite find someone as dedicated as Mike’s sister we could trust. 

At an early age, we found out how hard it was to find good staff. 

Three months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in the room. Some bullies from 
another neighborhood pushed their way in and started it. Mike’s dad suggested we shut down 
the business. So our comic-book business shut down, and we stopped working on Saturdays at 
the convenience store. Anyway, rich dad was excited because he had new things he wanted to 
teach us. He was happy because we had learned our first lesson so well. We had learned to 
have money work for us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced to use 
our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money. By starting our own business, the 
comic-book library, we were in control of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. 
The best part was that our business generated money for us, even when we weren’t physically 
there. Our money worked for us. Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much 
more.

CHAPTER THREE 


Lesson Two:Why Teach Financial Literacy? 

In 1990, my best friend, Mike, took over his father’s empire and is, in fact, doing a better job 
than his dad did. We see each other once or twice a year on the golf course. He and his wife 
are wealthier than you could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now 
grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us. 

In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife, Kim, was 37. Retirement does not mean not 
working. To my wife and me, it means that barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can 
work or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, staying way ahead of inflation. I guess it 
means freedom. The assets are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. 
You water it for years and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. It’s roots have gone down 
deep enough. Then, the tree provides shade for your enjoyment. 

Mike chose to run the empire and I chose to retire. 

Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would recommend or what could 
they do? “How do they get started?” “Is there a good book I would recommend?” “What should 
they do to prepare their children?” “What is the secret to success?” “How do I make millions?” I 
am always reminded of this article I was once given. It goes as follows. 

THE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN 

In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the 
Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest 
independent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the world’s largest utility; Howard 
Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger president of the International Match 
Co., one of the world’s largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of 
International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur 
Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of 
President Harding’s cabinet. Twenty five years later nine of them (those listed above) ended as 
follows. Schwab died penniless after living for five years on borrowed money. Instill died broke 
living in a foreign land. Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and 
Albert Fall were just released from prison. Fraser and Livermore committed suicide. 

I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men. If you look at the date, 1923, it 
was just before the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great 
impact on these men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of greater and 
faster change than these men did. I suspect there will be many booms and busts in the next 25 
years that will parallel the ups and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many 
people are focused too much on money and not their greatest wealth, which is their education. 
If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and 
richer through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people 
will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without

financial intelligence is money soon gone. 

Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money you make, it’s how much money 
you keep. We have all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, then 
poor again. They win millions and are soon back to where they started. Or stories of 
professional athletes, who, at the age of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are 
sleeping under a bridge by age 34. In the paper this morning, as I write this, there is a story of a 
young basketball player who a year ago had millions. Today, he claims his friends, attorney and 
accountant took his money, and now he works at a car wash for minimum wage. 

He is only 29. He was fired from the car wash because he refused to take off his championship 
ring as he was wiping off the cars, so his story made the newspaper. He is appealing his 
termination, claiming hardship and discrimination and that the ring is all he has left. He claims 
that if you take that away, he’ll crumble. 

In 1997, I know so many people who are becoming instant millionaires. It’s the Roaring ’20s 
one more time. And while I am glad people have been getting richer and richer, I only caution 
that in the long run, it’s not how much you make, it’s how much you keep, and how many 
generations you keep it. 

So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to get rich quick,” they often 
are greatly disappointed with my answer. I simply say to them what my rich dad said back to me 
when I was a little kid. “If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.” 

That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together. As I said, my educated dad 
stressed the importance of reading books, while my rich dad stressed the need to master 
financial literacy. 

If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing you need to do is dig a deep 
hole and pour a strong foundation. If you are going to build a home in the suburbs, all you need 
to do is pour a 6-inch slab of concrete. Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build 
an Empire State Building on a 6-inch slab. 

Our school system, having been created in the Agrarian Age, still believes in homes with no 
foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids graduate from school with virtually no financial 
foundation. One day, sleepless and deep in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream, they 
decide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a way to get rich quick. 

Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon, instead of the Empire State 
Building, we have the Leaning Tower of Suburbia. The sleepless nights return. 

As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were possible because we were 
taught to pour a strong financial foundation when we were just kids. 

Now, accounting is possibly the most boring subject in the world. It also could be the most 
confusing. But if you want to be rich, long term, it could be the most important subject. The 
question is, how do you take a boring and confusing subject and teach it to kids? The answer is, 
make it simple. Teach it first in pictures. 

My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me. Since we were just kids, he 


Page 40/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


created a simple way to teach us. For years he only drew pictures and used words. Mike and I 
understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money, and then in later years, 
rich dad began adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone on to master much more complex and 
sophisticated accounting analysis because he has had to. He has a billion-dollar empire to run. I 
am not as sophisticated because my empire is smaller, yet we come from the same simple 
foundation. In the following pages, I offer to you the same simple line drawings Mike’s dad 
created for us. Though simple, those drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums 
of wealth on a solid and deep foundation. 

Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you 
want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule. This may sound 
absurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle 
financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability. 

“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are 
assets” 

When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he was kidding. Here we were, 
nearly teenagers and waiting for the secret to getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so 
simple that we had to stop for a long time to think about it. 

“What is an asset?” asked Mike. 

“Don’t worry right now,” said rich dad. “Just let the idea sink in. If you can comprehend the 
simplicity, your life will have a plan and be financially easy. It is simple; that is why the idea is 
missed.” 

“You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them and we’ll be rich?” I asked. 
Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.” 

“If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked. 

Rich dad smiled. "Because people do not know the difference between an asset and a liability." 

I remember asking, “How could adults be so silly. If it is that simple, if it is that important, why 
would everyone not want to find out?” 

It took our rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and liabilities were. 

As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. Why? Because adults are smarter. In 
most cases, the simplicity of the idea escapes most adults because they have been educated 
differently. They have been educated by other educated professionals, such as bankers, 
accountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so forth. The difficulty comes in asking 
adults to unlearn, or become children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to 
pay attention to simplistic definitions. 

Rich dad believed in the KISS principle-“Keep It Simple Stupid”-so he kept it simple for two 
young boys, and that made the financial foundation strong. 

So what causes the confusion? Or how could something so simple be so screwed up? Why 


Page 41/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


would someone buy an asset that was really a liability. The answer is found in basic education. 

We focus on the word “literacy” and not “financial literacy.” What defines something to be an 
asset, or something to be a liability are not words. In fact, if you really want to be confused, look 
up the words “asset” and “liability” in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a 
trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense. But we adults are often too 
proud to admit that something does not make sense. 

As young boys, rich dad said, “What defines an asset is not words but numbers. And if you 
cannot read the numbers, you cannot tell an asset from a hole in the ground.” 

“In accounting,” rich dad would say, "it’s not the numbers, but what the numbers are telling you. 
It’s just like words. It’s not the words, but the story the words are telling you. 

Many people read, but do not understand much. It’s called reading comprehension. And we all 
have different abilities when it comes to reading comprehension. For example, I recently bought 
a new VCR. It came with an instruction book that explained how to program the VCR. All I 
wanted to do was record my favorite TV show on Friday night. I nearly went crazy trying to read 
the manual. Nothing in my world is more complex than learning how to program my VCR. I 
could read the words, but I understood nothing. I get an “A” for recognizing the words. I get an 
“F” for comprehension. And so it is with financial statements for most people. 

“If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand numbers.” If I heard that once, I 
heard it a thousand times from my rich dad. And I also heard, “The rich acquire assets and the 
poor and middle class acquire liabilities.” 

Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability. Most accountants and 
financial professionals do net agree with the definitions, but these simple drawings were the 
start of strong financial foundations for two young boys. 

To teach pre?teen boys, rich dad kept everything simple, using as many pictures as possible, as 
few words as possible, and no numbers for years. 

“This is the Cash Flow pattern of an asset.”

The above box is an Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss Statement. It measures 
income and expenses. Money in and money out. The bottom diagram is the Balance Sheet. It is 
called that because it is 

supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial novices don’t know the relationship 
between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet. That relationship is vital to understand. 

The primary cause of financial struggle is simply not knowing the difference between an asset 
and a liability. The cause of the confusion is found in the definition of the two words. If you want 
a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words “asset” and “liability” in the dictionary. 

Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average person, it may as well be 
written in Mandarin. You read the words in the definition, but true comprehension is difficult. 

So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that “assets put money in your 
pocket.” Nice, simple and usable. 

“This is Cash Flow pattern of a liability.”

Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it may be easier to 
understand my definitions in words. 

An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. 

A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket. 

This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If 
you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It’s not knowing the 
difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world. 

Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle. If people are having 


Page 43/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


difficulties financially, there is something that they cannot read, either in numbers or words. 
Something is misunderstood. The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas 
than people who struggle financially. So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it’s 
important to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers. 

The arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or “cash flow.” Numbers alone really 
mean little. Just as words alone mean little. It’s the story that counts. In financial reporting, 
reading numbers is looking for the plot, the story. The story of where the cash is flowing. In 80 
percent of most families, the financial story is a story of working hard in an effort to get ahead. 
Not because they don’t make money. But because they spend their lives buying liabilities instead 
of assets. 

For instance, this is the cash flow pattern of a poor person, or a young person still at home: 

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Rent Clothes Fun Transportation) 

Asset (none) 

Liability (none) 

This is the cash flow pattern of a person in the middle class: 

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Mortgage Clothes Fun Transportation) 

Asset (none) 

Liability (Mortgage Consumer loans Credit Cards) 

This is the cash flow pattern of a wealthy person: 

Assets(stocks bonds notes real estate intellectual property)->income (dividends interest rental 
income royalties) 

Liabilities (none) 

All of these diagrams were obviously oversimplified. Everyone has living expenses, the need for 
food, shelter and clothing. 

The diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy person’s life. It is 
the cash flow that tells the story. It is the story of how a person handles their money, what they 
do after they get the money in their hand. 

The reason I started with the story of the richest men in America is to illustrate the flaw in the 
thinking of so many people. The flaw is that money will solve all problems. That is why I cringe 
whenever 1 hear people ask me how to get rich quicker. Or where do they start? I often hear, 
“I’m in debt so I need lo make more money.” 

But more money will often not solve the problem; in fact, it may actually accelerate the 
problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws. Money often puts a spotlight on 
what we do not know. That is why, all too often, a person who comes into a sudden windfall of 
cash-let’s say an inheritance, a pay raise or lottery winnings-soon returns to the same financial 
mess, if not worse than the mess they were in before they received the money. Money only

accentuates the cash flow pattern running in your head. If your pattern is to spend everything 
you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending. Thus, the 
saying, “A fool and his money is one big party,” 1 have said many times that we go to school to 
gain scholastic skills and professional skills, both important. We learn to make money with our 
professional skills. In the 1960s, when I was in high school, if someone did well in school 
academically, almost immediately people assumed this bright student would go on to be a 
medical doctor. Often no one asked the child if they wanted to be a doctor. It was assumed. It 
was the profession with the promise of the greatest financial reward. 

Today, doctors are facing financial challenges I would not wish on my worst enemy; insurance 
companies taking control of the business, managed health care, government intervention, and 
malpractice suits, to name a few. Today, kids want to be basketball stars, golfers like Tiger 
Woods, computer nerds, movie stare, rock stars, beauty queens, or traders on Wall Street. 
Simply because that is where the fame, money and prestige is. That is the reason it is so hard to 
motivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to 
academic success, as it once was. 

Because students leave school without financial skills, millions of educated people pursue their 
profession successfully, but later find themselves struggling financially. They work harder, but 
don’t get ahead. What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to 
spend money-what to do after you make it. It’s called financial aptitude-what you do with the 
money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it, 
and how hard that money works for you. Most people cannot tell why they struggle financially 
because they don’t understand cash flow. A person can be highly educated, professionally 
successful and financially illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to because 
they learned how to work hard, but not how to have their money work for them. 

The story of bow the quest for a Financial Dream turns into a financial nightmare. The moving- 
picture show of hard-working people has a set pattern. Recently married, the happy, highly 
educated young couple move in together, in one of their cramped rented apartments. 
Immediately, they realize that they are saving money because two can live as cheaply as 

one. 

The problem is, the apartment is cramped. They decide to save money to buy their dream 
home so they can have kids. They now have two incomes, and they begin to focus on their 
careers. 

Their incomes begin to increase. 

As their incomes go up... their expenses go up as well. 

The No. 1 expense for most people is taxes. Many people think it’s income tax, but for most 
Americans their highest tax is Social Security. As an employee, it appears as if the Social 
Security tax combined with the Medicare tax rate is roughly 7.5 percent, but it’s really 15 
percent since the employer must match the Social Security amount. In essence, it is money the 
employer cannot pay you. On top of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount 
deducted from your wages for Social Security tax, income you never receive because it went 
directly to Social Security through withholding. Then, their liabilities go up.

This is best demonstrated by going back to the young couple. As a result of their incomes going 
up, they decide to go out and buy the house of their dreams. Once in their house, they have a 
new tax, called property tax. Then, they buy a new car, new furniture and new appliances to 
match [heir new house. Ail of a sudden, they wake up and their liabilities column is full of 
mortgage debt and credit-card debt. 

They’re now trapped in the rat race. A child comes along. They work harder. The process 
repeats itself. More money and higher taxes, also called bracket creep, A credit card comes in 
the mail. They use it. It maxes out. A loan company calls and says their greatest “asset,” their 
home, has appreciated in value. The company offers a “bill consolidation” loan, because their 
credit is so good, and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear off the high-interest consumer 
debt by paying off their credit card. And besides, interest on their home is a tax deduction. They 
go for it, and pay off those high-interest credit cards. They breathe a sigh of relief. Their credit 
cards are paid off. 

They’ve now folded their consumer debt into their home mortgage. Their payments go down 
because they extend their debt over 30 years. It is the smart thing to do. 

Their neighbor calls to invite them to go shopping-the Memorial Day sale is on. A chance to 
save some money. They say to themselves, “I won’t buy anything. I’ll just go look.” But just in 
case they find something, they tuck that clean credit card inside their wallet. 

I run into this young couple all the time. Their names change, but their financial dilemma is the 
same. They come to one of my talks to hear what I have to say. They ask me, “Can you tell us 
how to make more money?” Their spending habits have caused them to seek more income. 

They don’t even know that the trouble is really how they choose to spend the money they do 
have, and that is the real cause of their financial struggle. It is caused by financial illiteracy and 
not understanding the difference between an asset and a liability. 

More money seldom solves someone’s money problems. Intelligence solves problems, There is 
a saying a friend of mine says over and over to people in debt. 

“If you find you have dug yourself into a hole... stop digging.” 

As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers; “The power of 
the sword, the jewel and the mirror.” 

The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons 
and, because of this, is the supreme military presence in the world. 

The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, 
“Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” 

The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese 
legend, was the most treasured of the three. 

The poor and middle class all loo often allow the power of money to control them. By simply 
getting up and working harder, failing to ask themselves if what they do makes sense, they 


Page 46/114

shoot themselves in the foot as they leave for work every morning. By not fully understanding 
nioney, the vast majority of people allow the awesome power of money to control them. The 
power of money is used against them. 

If they used the power of the mirror, they would have asked themselves, “Does this make 
sense?” All too often, instead of trusting their inner wisdom, that genius inside of them, most 
people go along with the crowd. They do things because everybody else does it. They conform 
rather than question. Often, they mindlessly repeat what they have been told. Ideas such as 
“diversify” or “your home is an asset.” “Your home is your biggest investment.” “You get a tax 
break for going into greater debt.” “Get a safe job.” “Don’t make mistakes.” “Don’t take risks.” 

It is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death for most people. According 
to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of 
standing out, the fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, the fear of being an outcast. The fear of 
being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems. 

That is why my educated dad said the Japanese valued the power of the mirror the most, for it 
is only when we as humans look into the mirror do we find truth. And the main reason that most 
people say "Play it safel’ is out of fear. That goes for anything, be it sports, relationships, 
career, money. 

It is that same fear, the fear of ostracism that causes people to conform and not question 
commonly accepted opinions or popular trends. “Your home is an asset.” “Get a bill 
consolidation loan and get out of debt.” “Work harder.” “It’s a promotion.” “Someday I’ll be a 
vice president.” “Save money.” “When ! get a raise, I’ll buy us a bigger house.” “Mutual funds 
are safe.” “Tickle Me Elmo dolls are out of stock, but I just happen to have one in back that 
another customer has not come by for yet.” 

Many great financial problems are caused by going along with the crowd and trying to keep up 
with the Joneses. Occasionally, we all need to look in the mirror and be true to our inner 
wisdom rather than our fears. 

By the time Mike and I were 16 years old, we began to have problems in school. We were not 
bad kids. We just began to separate from the crowd. We worked for Mike’s dad after school and 
on the weekends. Mike and I often spent hours after work just sitting at a table with his dad 
while he held meetings with his bankers, attorneys, accountants, brokers, investors, managers 
and employees. Here was a man who had left school at the age of 13, now directing, 
instructing, ordering and asking questions of educated people. They came at his beck and call, 
and cringed when he did not approve of them. 

Here was a man who had not gone along with the crowd. He was a man who did his own 
thinking and detested the words, “We have to do it this way because that’s the way everyone 
else does it.” He also hated the word “can’t.” If you wanted him to do something, just say, "I 
don’t think 

you can do it." 

Mike and I learned more sitting at his meetings than we did in all our years of school, college 
included. Mike’s dad was not school educated, but he was financially educated and successful as 


Page 47/114

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


a result. He use to tell us over and over again. “An intelligent person hires people who are 
more intelligent than they are.” So Mike and I had the benefit of spending hours listening to 
and, in the process, learning From 

intelligent people. 

But because of this, both Mike and I just could not go along with the standard dogma that our 
teachers preached, And that caused the problems. Whenever the teacher said, “If you don’t get 
good grades, you won’t do well in the real world,” Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When 
we were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how this 
schooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to understand why our rich dad told 
us that schools were designed to produce good employees instead of employers. 

Occasionally Mike or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was applicable, or we asked 
why we never studied money and how it worked. To the later question, we often got the answer 
that money was not important, that if we excelled in our education, the money would follow. 

The more we knew about the power of money, the more distant we grew from the teachers and 
our classmates. 

My highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades. I often wondered why. But we did 
begin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I probably had a far better foundation with 
money than both my mom and dad. I could keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate 
attorneys, bankers, real estate brokers, investors and so forth. My dad talked to teachers. 

One day, my dad was telling me why our home was his greatest investment. A not-too-pleasant 
argument took place when I showed him why I thought a house was not a good investment. 

The following diagram illustrates the difference in perception between my rich dad and my poor 
dad when it came to their homes. One dad thought his house was an asset, and the other dad 
thought it was a liability. 

I remember when I drew a diagram for my dad showing him the direction of cash flow. I also 
showed him the ancillary expenses that went along with owning the home. A bigger home 
meant bigger expenses, and the cash flow kept going out through the expense column. 

Today, I am still challenged on the idea of a house not being an asset. And 1 know that for 
many people, it is their dream as well as their largest investment. And owning your own home is 
better than nothing. I simply offer an alternate way of looking at this popular dogma. If my wife 
and I were to buy a bigger, more flashy house we realize it would not be an asset, it would be a 

liability, since it would take money out of 

our pocket. 

So here is the argument I put forth. I really do not expect most people to agree with it because 
a nice home is an emotional thing. And when it comes to money, high emotions tend to lower 
financial intelligence. 1 know from personal experience that money has a way of making every 
decision emotional.

1. D When it comes to houses, I point out that most people work all their lives paying for a 
home they never own. In other words, most people buy a new house every so many years, each 
time incurring a new 30-year loan to pay off the previous one. 

2 . D Even though people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage payments, they pay 
for all their other expenses with after-tax dollars. Even after they pay off their mortgage. 

3. D Property taxes. My wife’s parents were shocked when the property taxes on their home 
went to $1,000 a month. This was after they had retired, so the increase put a strain on their 
retirement budget, and they felt forced to move. 

4 Houses do not always go up in value. In 1997, I still have friends who owe a million dollars for 
a home that will today sell for only $700,000. 

5. The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in 
your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of 
the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column, the classic middle class cash flow 
pattern. If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later 
years would get easier, especially as they prepared to send their children to college. Their assets 
would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses. All too often, a house only 
serves as a vehicle for incurring a home-equity loan to pay for mounting expenses. In summary, 
the end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an 
investment portfolio early on impacts an individual in at least the following three ways: 

1. Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value. 

2. Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high- 
maintenance expenses related directly to the home. 

3. Loss of education. Too often, people count their house, savings and retirement plan as all 
they have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply do not 
invest. This costs them investment 

experience. Most never become what the investment world calls a “sophisticated investor.” And 
the best investments are usually first sold to “sophisticated investors,” who then turn around and 
sell them to the people playing it safe. I am not saying don’t buy a house. I am saying, 
understand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first 
buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. 

My educated dad’s personal financial statement best demonstrates the life of someone in the rat 
race. His expenses seem to always keep up with his income, never allowing him to invest in 
assets. As a result, his liabilities, such as his mortgage and credit card debts are larger than his 
assets. The following picture is worth a thousand words: 

Educated Dad’s Einancial Statement 

Income = E xpe nse 

Asset < Liability

My rich dad’s personal financial statement, on the other hand, reflects the results of a life 
dedicated to investing and minimizing liabilities: 

Rich Dad’s Financial Statement 

Income > Expense 

Asset > Liability 

A review of my rich dad’s financial statement is why the rich get richer. The asset column 
generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the 
asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows 
with it. 

The result being: The rich get richer! 

Why the Rich Get Richer 

Income -> Assets -> More Income Expenses are low, Liabilities are low 

The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is 
through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase 
in equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase “the rat race.” They treat their 
home as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets. 

Why the Middle Class Struggle 

Income goes up, Expenses go up 

Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase 

This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means 
you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. This 
process of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial 
uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a 
regular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education. 

The massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has brought to light how 
shaky the middle class really is financially. Suddenly, company pension plans are being replaced 
by 401k plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and cannot be looked at as a source for 
retirement. Panic has sei in for the middle class. The good thing today is that many of these 
people have recognized these issues and have begun buying mutual funds. This increase in 
investing is largely responsible for the huge rally we have seen in the stock market. Today, there 
are more and more mutual funds being created to answer the demand by the middle class. 

Mutual funds are popular because they represent safety. Average mutual fund buyers are too 
busy working to pay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college and pay off credit 
cards. They do not have time to study to learn how to invest, so they rely on the expertise of 
the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the mutual fund includes many different types of 
investments, they feel their money is safer because ii is “diversified.”

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


This group of educated middle class subscribes to the “diversify” dogma put out by mutual fund 
brokers and financial planners. Play it safe. Avoid risk. 

The real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what creates the risk faced by 
average middle class people. The reason they have to play it safe is because their financial 
positions are tenuous at best. Their balance sheets are not balanced. They are loaded with 
liabilities, with no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source of income is 
their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent on their employer. 

So when genuine “deals of a lifetime” come along, those same people cannot take advantage of 
the opportunity. They must play it safe, simply because they are working so hard, are taxed to 
the max, and are loaded with debt. 

As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule is to know the difference between 
an asset and a liability. Once you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on only 
buying income-generating assets. That’s the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich. 
Keep doing that, and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses 
down. This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column. Soon, 
the asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments. 
Investments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity. Investments that for $5,000 are 
soon turned into $1 million or more. Investments that the middle class calls “too risky.” The 
investment is not risky. It’s the lack of simple financial intelligence, beginning with financial 
literacy, that causes the individual to be “too risky,” 

If you do what the masses do, you get the following picture. 

Income = Work for Owner Expense = Work for Government Asset = (none) Liability = Work for 
Bank 

As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally as follows: 

l.D You work for someone else. Most people, working for a paycheck, are making the owner, 
or the shareholders richer. Your efforts and success will help provide for the owner’s success 
and retirement. 

2.0 You work for the government. The government takes its share from your paycheck before 
you even see it. By working harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes taken by the 
government - most people work from January to May just for the government. 

3.D You work for the bank. After taxes, your next largest expense is usually your mortgage and 
credit card debt. 

The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share 
of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and 
your family directly. 

Once you have decided to concentrate on minding your own business, how do you set your 
goals? For most people, they must keep their profession and rely on their wages to fund their 
acquisition of assets.

As their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their success? When does someone 
realize that they are rich, that they have wealth? As well as having my own definitions for assets 
and liabilities, I also have my own definition for wealth. Actually 1 borrowed it from a man named 
Buckminster Fuller. Some call him a quack, and others call him a living genius. Years ago he got 
all the architects buzzing because he applied for a patent in 1961 for something called a 
geodesic dome. But in the application, Fuller also said something about wealth. It was pretty 
confusing at first, but after reading it for awhile, it began to make some sense: Wealth is a 
person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how 
long could I survive? 

Unlike net worth-the difference between your assets and liabilities, which is often filled with a 
person’s expensive junk and opinions of what things are worth-this definition creates the 
possibility for developing a truly accurate measurement. I could now measure and really know 
where I was in terms of my goal to become financially independent. 

Although net worth often includes these non-cash-producing assets, like stuff you bought that 
now sits in your garage, wealth measures how much money your money is making and, 
therefore, your financial survivability. 

Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense 
column. 

Let’s use an example. Let’s say I have cash flow from my asset column of S"J,000 a month. 
And I have monthly expenses of 52,000. What is my wealth? 

Let’s go back to Buckminster Fuller’s definition. Using his definition, how many days forward 
can I survive? And let’s assume a 30-day month. By that definition, I have enough cash flow for 
half a month. 

When I have achieved $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then I will be wealthy. 

So I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month 
that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my 
cash flow from assets to maintain this level of wealth. Take notice that it is at this point that I no 
longer am dependent on my wages. I have focused on and been successful in building an asset 
column that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to 
cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets. 

My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset 
column. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. 
The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses 
less than the cash flow from these assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from 
sources other than my physical labor. 

As this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to being rich. The actual definition 
of rich is in the eye of the beholder. You can never be too rich. 

Just remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The 
middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. So how do I start minding my own business?

CHAPTER FOUR 


Lesson Three: Mind Your Own Business 

In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s, was asked to speak to the MBA class at the 
University of Texas at Austin. A dear friend of mine, Keith Cunningham, was a student in that 
MBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if 
he would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray graciously accepted. 

“What business am 1 in?” Ray asked, once the group had all their beers in hand. 

“Everyone laughed,” said Keith. “Most of the MBA students thought Ray was just fooling 
around.” 

No one answered, so Ray asked the question again. “What business do you think I’m in?” 

The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled out, “Ray, who in the world does 
not know that you’re in the hamburger business.” 

Ray chuckled. “That is what I thought you would say.” He paused and then quickly said, ’ladies 
and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger business. My business is real estate." 

Keith said that Ray spent a good amount of time explaining his viewpoint. In their business plan, 
Ray knew that the primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what he never 
lost sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew that the real estate and its location was 
the most significant factor in the success of each franchise. Basically, the person that bought the 
franchise was also paying for, buying, the land under the franchise for Ray Kroc’s organization. 

McDonald’s today is the largest single owner of real estate in the world, owning even more than 
the Catholic Church. Today, McDonald’s owns some of the most valuable intersections and 
street corners in America, as well as in other parts of the world. 

Keith said it was one of the most important lessons in his life. Today, Keith owns car washes, 
but his business is the real estate under those car washes. 

The previous chapter ended with the diagrams illustrating that most people work for everyone 
else but themselves. They work first for the owners of the company, then for the government 
through taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortgage. 

As a young boy, we did not have a McDonald’s nearby. Yet, my rich dad was responsible for 
teaching Mike and me the same lesson that Ray Kroc talked about at the University of Texas. It 
is secret No. 3 of the rich. 

The secret is: "Mind your own business/’ Financial struggle is often directly the result of people 
working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their 
working days. 

Again, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a diagram of the income statement and 


Page 54/114 


http : / / motsach . info

balance sheet that best describes Ray Kroc’s advice: 

Most people 

Your Profession -> Your Income 
The Rich 

Your Assets -> Your Income 

Our current educational system focuses on preparing today’s youth to get good jobs by 
developing scholastic skills. Their lives will revolve around their wages, or as described earlier, 
their income column. And after developing scholastic skills, they go on to higher levels of 
schooling to enhance their professional abilities. They study to become engineers, scientists, 
cooks, police officers, artists, writers and so on. These professional skills allow them to enter the 
workforce and work for money. 

There is a big difference between your profession and your business. Often I ask people, “What 
is your business?” And they will say, “Oh I’m a banker.” Then I ask them if they own the bank? 
And they usually respond. “No, I work there.” 

In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may 
be a banker, but they still need their own business. Ray Kroc was clear on the difference 
between his profession and his business. His profession was always the same. Me was a 
salesman. At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling 
hamburger franchises- But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business 
was the accumulation of income-producing real estate. 

A problem with school is that you often become what you study. So if you study, say, cooking, 
you become a chef. If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto 
mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many 
people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s 
business and making that person rich. 

To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business 
revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column. As stated earlier, the 
No. 1 rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich 
focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements. 

That is why we hear so often: “I need a raise.” “If only I had a promotion.” “I am going to go 
back to school to get more training so I can get a better job.” "I am going to work overtime.” 
“Maybe I can get a second job.” “I’m quitting in two weeks. I found a job that pays more.” 

In some circles, these are sensible ideas. Yet, if you listen to Ray Kroc, you are still not minding 
your own business. These ideas all still focus on the income column and will only help a person 
become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating 
assets. 

The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative-which 
means. “I can’t afford to take risks”-is that they have no financial foundation. They have to cling 


Page 55/114

to their jobs. They have to play it safe. 

When downsizing became the “in” thing lo do, millions of workers I found out their largest so- 
called asset, their home, was eating them alive, j Their asset, called a house, still cost them 
money every month. Their car, another “asset,” was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the 
garage that cost $1,000 were not worth 51,000 anymore. Without job security, they had 
nothing to fall back on. What they thought were assets could not help them survive in a time of 
financial crisis. 

1 assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to buy a house or to buy a 
car. It is always interesting to look at the "net worth’ 1 section. It is interesting because of what 
accepted banking and accounting practices allow a person to count as assets. 

One day, to get a loan, my financial position did not look too good. So I added my new golf 
clubs, my art collection, books, stereo, television, Armani suits, wristwatches, shoes and other 
personal effects to boost the number in the asset column. 

But I was turned down for the loan because I had too much investment real estate. The loan 
committee did not like that 1 made so much money off of apartment houses. They wanted to 
know why I did not have a normal job, with a salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf 
clubs or art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the “standard” profile. 

I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or 
$100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply 
because the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains. 

So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run short of income. 
To raise cash, they sell their assets. First, their personal assets can generally be sold for only a 
fraction of the value that is listed in their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale 
of the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share of the gain, 
thus reducing the amount available to help them out 

Of debt. That is why 1 say someone’s net worth is often “worth less” than they think. 

Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not 
liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home. A new car loses 
nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true 
asset even if your banker lets you list it as one. My $400 new titanium driver was worth S150 
the moment I teed off. 

For adults, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid 
assets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is important for parents to teach them 
the difference between an asset and a liability. Get them to start building a solid asset column 
before they leave home, get married, buy a house, have kids and get stuck in a risky financial 
position, clinging to a job and buying everything on credit. I see so many young couples who get 
married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let them get out of debt for most of their 
working years. 

For most people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize they have not adequately

prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble to put some money away. Then, their own 
parents become ill and they find themselves with new responsibilities. 

So what kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children acquire? In my world, real 
assets fall into several different categories: 

1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are managed or run by 
other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job. 

2. Stocks. 

3. Bonds. 

4. Mutual funds. 

5. Income-generating real estate. 

6. Notes (lOUs). 

7. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents. 

8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market. 

As a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job. My rich dad, on the other 
hand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved. “If you don’t love it, you won’t take 
care of it.” I collect real estate simply because I love buildings and land. I love shopping for 
them. 1 could look at them all day long. When problems arise, the problems are not so bad that 
it changes my love for real estate. For people who hate real estate, they shouldn’t buy it. 

I love stocks of small companies, especially startups. The reason is that I am an entrepreneur, 
not a corporate person. In my early years. I worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil 
of California, the U.S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with those 
organizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down I am not a company man. I like 
starting companies, not running them. So my slock buys are usually of small companies, and 
sometimes I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in new-stock issues, 
and I love the game. Many people are afraid of small-cap companies and call them risky, and 
they are. But risk is always diminished if you love what the investment is, understand it and 
know the game. With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a 
year. My real estate strategy, on the other hand, is to start small and keep trading the properties 
up for bigger properties and, therefore, delaying paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value 
to increase dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years. 

For years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox, I did what my rich dad 
recommended. I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my 
asset column. I traded real estate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of 
financial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the 
better I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company. 

I would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. Knowing what I 
know about running a company, I would not wish that task on anyone. There are times when 


Page 57/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


people cannot find employment, where starting a company is a solution for them. The odds are 
against success: Nine out of 10 companies fail in five years. Of those that survive the first five 
years, nine out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well. So only if you really have the desire 
to own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your daytime job and mind your 
own business. When I say mind your own business, 1 mean to build and keep your asset column 
strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes 
into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 
24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working 
employee, but keep building that asset column. 

As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people 
buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the 
middle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because 
they want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The 
old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated 
from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their 
own sweat, blood and children’s inheritance. 

A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. For example, when my 
wife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her 
Mercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on her part because the apartment house 
bought the car. She did, however, have to wait for it for four years while the real estate 
investment portfolio grew and finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the 
car. But the luxury, the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to 
grow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than simply another pretty car. It 
means she used her financial intelligence to afford it. 

What most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some other luxury, on 
credit. They may feel bored and just want a new toy. Buying a luxury on credit often causes a 
person to sooner or later actually resent that luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a 
financial burden. 

After you’ve taken the time and invested in and built your own business, you are now ready to 
add the magic touch-the biggest secret of the rich. The secret that puts the rich way ahead of 
the pack. The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own 
business.

CHAPTER FIVE 


Lesson FounThe History of and The Power of Corporation 

I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher 
thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the 
rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood 
a crook. 

Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still hear people say, “Why 
don’t the rich pay for it?” Or “The rich should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.” 

It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the 
most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is 
because of the Robin Hood ideal. The real reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle 
class who pays for the poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class. 

Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the historical perspective. We 
need to look at the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an expert on the 
history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as an expert on the history of taxes. 

Rich dad explained to Mike and me that in England and America originally, there were no taxes. 
Occasionally there were temporary taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the 
president would put the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in Britain for 
the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in America taxes were levied to pay for the 
Civil War from 1861 to 1865. 

In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, an income tax 
became permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the 
Constitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the excessive tax on tea that led 
to the famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary 
War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and ’ the United States to sell the idea of a 
regular income tax. ; 

What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes were initially levied against 
only the rich. It was this point that rich dad wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained 
that the idea of taxes was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and 
the middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted 
for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to punish the rich, in 
reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class. 

“Once government got a taste of money, the appetite grew,” said rich dad. “Your dad and I are 
exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat, and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our 
success is measured on opposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The 
more he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In the 
government, the larger his organization, the more he is respected. On the other hand, within 


Page 59/114

my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money 1 spend, the more I am respected 
by my investors. That’s why I don’t like government people. They have different objectives from 
most business people. As the government grows, more and more tax dollars will be needed to 
support it.” 

My educated dad sincerely believed that government should help 

people. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace Corps. He loved the 
idea so much that both he and my mom worked for the Peace Corps training volunteers to go to 
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. He always strived for additional grants and increases in 
his budget so he could hire more people, both in his job with the Education Department and in 
the Peace Corps. That was his job. 

From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that government workers 
were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would hear how the rich were greedy 
crooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both sides have valid points. It was difficult to go 
to work for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a 
prominent government leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe. 

Yet, when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective emerges. As I said, the 
passage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of 
economics, which was to take from the rich and give to everyone else. The problem was that 
the government’s appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the 
middle class, and from there it kept “trickling down.” 

The rich, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. They do not play by the same set of rules. As 
I’ve stated, the rich already knew about corporations, which became popular in the days of 
sailing ships. The rich created the corporation as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each 
voyage. The rich put their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation 
would then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasures. If the ship was lost, the 
crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be limited only to the money they invested for 
that particular voyage. The diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits outside 
your personal income statement and balance sheet. 

How the Rich Play the Game 

Is reduced/diminished by expenses Assets > Income (through 

personal corporation) 

It is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the 
rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two fathers teaching me, one a 
socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist 
made more financial sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized 
themselves, due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the “Take from the rich” 
crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. That is how taxes were 
eventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they 
understood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools. 

How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “Take from the rich” tax was passed, cash 


Page 60/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


started flowing into government coffers. Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to 
government workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of jobs and 
pensions. It went to the rich via their factories receiving government contracts. The government 
became a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. 
There really is no recirculation. In other words, the government policy, if you were a 
government bureaucrat, was to avoid having excess money. If you failed to spend your allotted 
funding, you risked losing it in the next budget. 

You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the other hand, 
are rewarded for having excess money and are recognized for their efficiency. 

As this cycle of growing government spending continued, the demand for money increased and 
the “Tax the rich” idea was now being adjusted to include lower-income levels, down to the very 
people who voted it in, the poor and the middle class. 

True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find a way to escape. They headed back 
to the protection of a corporation. A corporation protects the rich. But what many people who 
have never formed a corporation do not know is that a corporation is not really a thing. A 
corporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s 
office registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big building with the name of the 
corporation on it. It’s not a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a legal 
document that creates a legal body without a soul. The wealth of the rich was once again 
protected. Once again, the use of corporations became popular-once the permanent income 
laws were passed- because the income-tax rate of the corporation was less than the individual 
income-tax rates. In addition, as described earlier, certain expenses could be paid with pre-tax 
dollars within the corporation. 

This war between the haves and have-nots has been going on for hundreds of years. It is the 
“Take from the rich” crowd versus the rich. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws 
are made. The battle will go on forever. The problem is, the people who lose are the 
uninformed. The ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they 
only understood the way the rich play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on 
their way to their own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent 
advise their children to go to school, so they can find a safe, secure job. An employee with a 
safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape. 

Average Americans today work five to six months for the government before they make enough 
to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is a long time. The harder you work, the more you pay 
the government. That is why I believe that the 

idea of “Take from the rich” backfired on the very people who voted it in. 

Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply 

comply, they react. They have the money, power and intent to change things. They do not just 
sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. They search for ways to minimize their tax burden. 
They hire smart attorneys j and accountants, and persuade politicians to change laws or create 
legal loopholes. They have the resources to effect change. 


Page 61/114

The Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to save on taxes. Most of these 
vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich who usually look for them because they are 
minding their own business. For example, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate; that is sold 
for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is 
one investment vehicle that allows such a great tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in 
value, you I will not be taxed on the gains, until you liquidate. People who do not take advantage 
of these tax savings offered legally are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns. 

The poor and middle class do not have the same resources. They sit there and let the 
government’s needles enter their arm and allow the blood donation to begin. Today, I am 
constantly shocked at the number of people who pay more taxes, or take fewer deductions, 
simply because they are afraid of the government. And I do know how frightening and 
intimidating a government tax agent can be. I have had friends who have had their businesses 
shut down and destroyed, only to find out it was a mistake on the part of the government. I 
realize all that. But the price of working from January to mid-May is a high price to pay for that 
intimidation. My poor dad never fought back. My rich dad didn’t either. He just played the game 
smarter, and he did it through corporations-the biggest secret of the rich. 

You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a little boy of 9 who had to 
sit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. 1 often sat in his office waiting for him to “get to 
me.” He was ignoring me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to 
have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he 
always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that 
requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world 
pushes you around. Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not 
the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man will always take more if you let him. 

The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all 
about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money 
works for you, you keep and control the power. 

Once we had this knowledge of the power of money working for us, he wanted us to be 
financially smart and not let bullies push us around. You need to know the law and how the 
system works. If you’re ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you’re talking about, 
you have a fighting chance. That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and 
attorneys. It was less expensive to pay them than pay the government. His best lesson to me, 
which I have used most of my life, is “Be smart and you won’t be pushed around as much.” He 
knew the law because he was a law-abiding citizen. He knew the law because it was expensive 
to not know the law. “If you know you’re right, you’re not afraid of fighting back.” Even if you 
are taking on Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men. 

My highly educated dad always encouraged me to seek a good job with a strong corporation. He 
spoke of the virtues of “working your way up the corporate ladder.” He didn’t understand that, 
by relying solely on a paycheck from a corporate employer, I would be a docile cow ready for 
milking. 

When I told my rich dad of my father’s advice, he only chuckled. “Why not own the ladder?” 


Page 62/114

was all he said. 

As a young boy, I did not understand what rich dad meant by owning my own corporation. It 
was an idea that seemed impossible, and intimidating. Although I was excited by the idea, my 
youth would not let me envision the possibility that grownups would someday work for a 
company I would own. 

The point is, if not for my rich dad, I would have probably followed my educated dad’s advice. It 
was merely the occasional reminder of my rich dad that kept the idea of owning my own 
corporation alive and kept me on a different path. By the time I was 15 or 16, 1 knew I was not 
going to continue down the path my educated dad was recommending. I did not know how I was 
going to do it, but I was determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates were 
heading. That decision changed my life. 

It was not until I was in my mid-20s that my rich dad’s advice began to make more sense. I was 
just out of the Marine Corps and working for Xerox. I was making a lot of money, but every 
time I looked at my paycheck, I was always disappointed. The deductions were so large, and the 
more I worked, the greater the deductions. As I became more successful, my bosses talked 
about promotions and raises. It was flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking me in my ear: 
“Who are you working for? Who are you making rich?” 

In 1974, while still an employee for Xerox, I formed my first corporation and began “minding 
my own business.” There were already a few assets in my asset column, but now I was 
determined to focus on making it bigger. Those paychecks with all the deductions made all the 
years of my rich dad’s advice make total sense. I could see the future if I followed my educated 
dad’s advice. 

Many employers feel that advising their workers to mind their own business is bad for business. I 
am sure it can be for certain individuals. But for me, focusing on my own business, developing 
assets, made me a better employee. I now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, 
amassing as much money as possible so I could begin investing in real estate. Hawaii was just set 
to boom, and there were 4 fortunes to be made. The more I realized we were in the beginning 
stages of a boom, the more Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made, 
and, of course, the more deductions there were from my paycheck. It was inspiring. I wanted 
out of the trap of being an employee so badly that I worked harder, not less. By 1978,1 was 
consistently one of the top five salespeople in sales, often No. 1. I badly wanted out of the rat 
race. 

In less than three years, I was making more in my own little corporation, which was a real estate 
holding company, than I was making at Xerox. And the money I was making in my asset 
column, in my own corporation, was money working for me. Not me pounding on doors selling 
copiers. My rich dad’s advice made much more sense. Soon the cash flow from my properties 
was so strong that my company bought me my first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople 
thought I was spending my commissions. I wasn’t. I was investing my commissions in assets. 

My money was working hard to make more money. Each dollar in my asset column was a great 
employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche with before- 
tax dollars. I began to work harder for Xerox. The plan was working, and my Porsche was the

proof. 

By using the lessons I learned from my rich dad, I was able to get out of the “proverbial rat race” 
of being an employee at an early age. It was made possible because of the strong financial 
knowledge I had acquired through these lessons. Without this financial knowledge, which I call 
financial IQ, my road to financial independence would have been much more difficult. I now 
teach others through financial seminars in the hope that I may share my knowledge with them. 
Whenever 1 do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four 
broad areas of expertise. 

No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The 
more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes 
tumbling down. This is the left brain side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read 
and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of any business. 

No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and 
formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side. 

No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know 
the “technical” aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; the Tickle Me Elmo doll during 
Christmas 1996 is a case of a technical or emotion-driven market. The other market factor is 
the “fundamental” or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or 
does it not make sense based on the current market conditions. 

Many people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market are too complex for 
kids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects intuitively. For those not familiar with the 
Elmo doll, it was a Sesame Street character that was highly touted to the kids just before 
Christmas. Most all kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents 
wondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while continuing to 
advertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and lack of supply. Having no dolls 
to buy in the stores, scalpers saw an opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate 
parents. The unlucky parents who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for 
Christmas. The incredible popularity of the Tickle Me Elmo doll made no sense to me, but it 
serves as an excellent example of supply and demand economics. The same thing goes on in 
the stock, bond, real estate and baseball-card markets. 

No. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the technical skills of 
accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. An individual with the knowledge of 
the tax advantages and protection provided by a corporation can get rich so much faster than 
someone who is an employee or a small-business sole proprietor. It’s like the difference 
between someone walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to 
long-term wealth. 

1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for 
expenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is so exciting, but not 
necessary to get into unless you have sizable assets or a business. Employees earn and get taxed 
and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed 


Page 64/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy 
to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For 
example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car 
payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company 
expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre- 
tax dollars. 

2. Protection from lawsuits. We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your 
action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to 
protect their assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met 
with layers of legal protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. 
They control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and 
lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich. They learned it from the 
Robin Hood story. Take from the rich, give to the poor. 

It is not the purpose of this book to go into the specifics of owning a corporation. But I will say 
that if you own any kind of legitimate assets, I would consider finding out more about the 
benefits and protection offered by a corporation as soon as possible. There are many books 

written on the subject that will detail the benefits and even walk you through the steps necessary 
to set up a corporation. One book in particular, Inc. and Grow Rich provides a wonderful insight 
into the power of personal corporations. 

Financial IQ is actually the synergy of many skills and talents. But I would say it is the 
combination of the four technical skills listed above that make up basic financial intelligence. If 
you aspire to great wealth, it is the combination of these skills that will greatly amplify an 
individual’s financial intelligence. 

In summary 

1. D Spend 2. Pay Taxes 

2. D Pay Taxes 3. Spend 

As part of your overall financial strategy, we strongly recommend owning your own corporation 
wrapped around your assets.

CHAPTER SIX 


Lesson Five:The Rich Invent Money 

Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the history of a young 
man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone, and was having 
growing pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong. Needing a bigger 
company, he then went to the giant at that time, Western Union, and asked them if they would 
buy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The 
president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down, saying the price was 
ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born. 

The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell ended. On the news 
was a story of another downsizing at a local company. The workers were angry and complained 
that the company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his 
wife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask 
if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it. 
The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. Needless to say, it held my 
attention. 

I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great experience and rewarding. It 
is also a disturbing profession, for I have 

taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us, myself included. We 
all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all 
of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that 
holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others. 

Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not as much a matter of college degrees or 
good grades that count. In the real world outside of academics, something more than just grades 
is required. I have heard it called “guts,” “chutzpah,” “balls,” “audacity,” “bravado,” “cunning,” 
“daring,” “tenacity” and “brilliance.” This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one’s 
future much more than school grades. 

Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant and daring characters. There is also the flip side 
of that character: people who could get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year 
in Vietnam, as a Marine Corps pilot, I intimately got to know both of those characters-inside of 
me. One is not better than the other. 

Yet, as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest 
detractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the 
courage to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart that get ahead but the 
bold. 

In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical knowledge as well as 
courage. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed. In my classes I strongly urge students to 


Page 66/114

learn to take risks, to be bold, to let their genius convert that fear into power and brilliance. It 
works for some and just terrifies others. I have come to realize that for most people, when it 
comes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions such 
as: Why take risks? Why should I bother developing my financial IQ? Why should I become 
financially literate? 

And I answer, “Just to have more options.” 

There are huge changes up head. Just as I started with the story of the young inventor 
Alexander Graham Bell, in the coming years there will be more people just like him. There will 
be a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely successful companies like Microsoft created 
every year, all over the world. And there also will be many more bankruptcies, layoffs and 
downsizing. 

So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. Yet, I can tell you 
why I myself do it. I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I’d rather be welcoming 
change than dreading change. I’d rather be excited about making millions than worrying about 
not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our 
world’s history. Generations from now, people will look back at this period of time and remark 
at what an exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old and birth of the new. It 
was full of turmoil and it was exciting. 

So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you will prosper greatly. And if 
you don’t, this period of time will be a frightening one. It will be a time of watching people 
move boldly forward while others cling to decaying life rings. 

Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the wealth. Then, it 
was factories and production, and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the 
wealth. Today, it is information. And the person who has the most timely information owns the 
wealth. The problem is, information flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new 
wealth cannot be contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The changes 
will be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number of new 
multimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind. 

Today, I find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply because they cling to old 
ideas. They want things to be the way they were; they resist change. I know people who are 
losing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly 
they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a 
liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an 
asset yesterday, yesterday is gone. 

One afternoon I was teaching investing using a board game I had invented, CASHFLOW, as a 
teaching tool. A friend had brought someone along to attend the class. This friend of a friend 
was recently divorced, had been badly burned in the divorce settlement, and was now searching 
for some answers. Her friend thought the class might help. 

The game was designed to help people learn how money works. In playing the game, they 
learn about the interaction of the income statement with the balance sheet. They learn how 
“cash flows” between 


Page 67/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


the two and how the road to wealth is through striving to increase your monthly cash flow from 
the asset column to the point that it exceeds your j monthly expenses. Once you accomplish 
this, you are able to get out of the “Rat Race” and out onto the “Fast Track”. 

As I have said, some people hate the game, some love it, and others miss the point. This 
woman missed a valuable opportunity to learn something. In the opening round, she drew a 
“doodad” card with the boat on it. At first she was happy. “Oh, I’ve got a boat.” Then, as her 
friend tried to explain how the numbers worked on her income statement and balance sheet, 
she got frustrated because she “had never liked math. The rest of her table waited while her 
friend continued explaining the relationship between the income statement, balance sheet and 
monthly cash flow. Suddenly, when she realized how the numbers worked, it dawned on her 
that her boat was eating her alive. Later on in the game, she was also ’’downsized" and had a 
child. It was a horrible game for her. 

After the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset. She had come to the class to 
learn about investing and did not like the idea that it took so long to play a silly game. 

Her friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if the game “reflected” on herself 
in any way. With that suggestion, the woman demanded her money back. She said that the very 
idea that a game could be a reflection of her was ridiculous. Her money was promptly refunded 
and she left. 

Since 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the school system does not. In school, 
most teachers lecture. I hated lectures as a student; I was soon bored and my mind would drift. 

In 1984,1 began teaching via games and simulations. I always encouraged adult students to look 
at games as reflecting back to what they know, and what they needed to learn. Most 
importantly, a game reflects back on one’s behavior. It’s an instant feedback system. Instead of 
the teacher lecturing you, the game is feeding back a personalized lecture, custom made just for 
you. 

The friend of the woman who left later called to give me an update. She said her friend was fine 
and had calmed down. In her cooling-off period, she could see some slight relationship between 
the game and her life. 

Although she and her husband did not own a boat, they did own 

everything else imaginable. She was angry after their divorce, both because he had run off with 
a younger woman and because after twenty years of marriage, they had accumulated little in the 
way of assets. There was virtually nothing for them to split. Their twenty years of married life 
had been incredible fun, but all they had accumulated was a ton of doodads. 

She realized that her anger at doing the numbers-the income statement and balance sheet-came 
from her embarrassment of not understanding them. She had believed that finances were the 
man’s job. She maintained the house and did the entertaining, and he handled the finances. She 
was now quite certain that in the last five years of their marriage, he had hidden money from 
her. She was angry at herself for not being more aware of where the money was going, as well 
as for not knowing about the other woman.

Just like a board game, the world is always providing us with instant feedback. We could learn a 
lot if we tuned in more. One day not long ago, I complained to my wife that the cleaners must 
have shrunk my pants. My wife gently smiled and poked me in the stomach to inform me that 
the pants had not shrunk, something else had expanded me! 

The game CASHFLOW was designed to give every player personal feedback. Its purpose is to 
give you options. If you draw the boat card and it puts you into debt, the question is, “Now what 
can you do?” How many different financial options can you come up with? That is the purpose 
of the game: to teach players to think and create new and various financial options. 

I have watched this game played by more than 1,000 people. The people who get out of the 
“Rat Race” in the game the quickest are the people who understand numbers and have creative 
financial minds. They recognize different financial options. People who take the longest are 
people who are not familiar with numbers and often do not understand the power of investing. 
Rich people are often creative and take calculated risks. 

There have been people playing CASHFLOW who gain lots of money in the game, but they 
don’t know what to do with it. Most of them have not been financially successful in real life 
either. Everyone else seems to be getting ahead of them, even though they have money. And 
that is true in real life. There are a lot of people who have a lot of money and do not get ahead 
financially.

CHAPTER SEVEN 


<div class=’story_text’>Lesson Six:Work to Learn -Don’t Work for Money</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In 1995,1 granted an interview with a newspaper in Singapore. The young 
female reporter was on time, and the interview got under way immediately. We sat in the lobby 
of a luxurious hotel, sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore. I was to 
share the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was speaking on motivation, and I was speaking on “The 
Secrets of the Rich.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“Someday, I would like to be a best-selling 
author like you,” she said. I had seen some of the articles she had written for the paper, and I 
was impressed. She had a tough, clear style of writing. Her articles held a reader’s interest. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>“You have a great style,” I said in reply. “What holds you back from 
achieving your dream?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“My work does not seem to go anywhere,” 
she said quietly. “Everyone says that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens. So I keep 
my job with the paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you have any suggestions?”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>“Yes, I do,” I said brightly. “A friend of mine here in Singapore runs a school 
that trains people to sell. He runs sales-training courses for many of the top corporations here in 
Singapore, and I think attending one of his courses would greatly enhance your career. ”</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>She stiffened. “Are you saying I should go to school to learn to 
sell?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>I nodded. </p> <div class=’story_text’>“You aren’t serious, 
are you?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Again, I nodded. “What is wrong with that?” I was now 
backpeddling. She was offended by something, and now I was wishing 11 had not said anything. 
In my attempt to be helpful, I found myself defending my suggestion. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>“I have a master’s degree in English Literature. Why would I go to school to 
learn to be a salesperson? I am a professional. I went to school to be trained in a profession so I 
would not have to be a salesperson. I hate salespeople. All they want is money. So tell me why I 
I should study sales?” She was now packing her briefcase forcibly. The interview was over.</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>On the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote. I I 
picked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad. I “Do you see this?” I 
said pointing to her notes. </p> <div class=’story_text’>She looked down at her notes. “What,” 
she said, confused. </p> <div class=’story_text’> Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes. On 
her pad she had written “Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“lt 
says ’best-selling author,’ not best ’writing’ author. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Her eyes 
widened immediately. </p> <div class=’story_text’>“I am a terrible writer. You are a great 
writer. I went to sales school. You have a master’s degree. Put them together and you get a 
’best-selling author’ and a ’best-writing author. ”’</p> <div class=’story_text’> Anger flared from 
her eyes. “I’ll never stoop so low as to learn how to sell. People like you have no business 
writing. I am a professionally trained writer and you are a salesman. It is not fair.”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The rest of her notes were put away, and she hurried out through the j, large 
glass doors into the humid Singapore morning. </p> <div class=’story_text’>At least she gave 
me a fair and favorable write-up the next morning. </p> <div class =’story_text’>The world is 
filled with smart, talented, educated and gifted people. We meet them every day. They are all 
around us.</p> <div class=’story_text’>A few days ago, my car was not running well. I pulled 
into a garage, and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew what was 


Page 70/114

wrong by simply listening to the engine. I was amazed. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The sad 
truth is, great talent is not enough. </p> <div class=’story_text’>I am constantly shocked at how 
little talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn 
more than $100,000 a year. I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than 
$20,000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how 
many doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I thought that when 
they graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the 
phrase, “They are one skill away from great wealth. ”</p> <div class =’story_text’> What this 
phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their 
income would jump exponentially. I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a 
synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. Combine those four technical skills and 
making money with money is easier. When it comes to money, the only skill most people know 
is to work hard.</p> <div class=’story_text’>The classic example of a synergy of skills was that 
young writer for the newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing, her 
income would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some courses in advertising 
copywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of working at the newspaper, I would seek a job at an 
advertising agency. Even if it were a cut in pay, she would learn how to communicate in “short 
cuts” that are used in successful advertising. She also would spend time learning public relations, 
an important skill. She would learn how to get millions in free publicity. Then, at night and on 
weekends, she could be writing her great novel. When it was finished, she would be better able 
to sell her book. Then, in a short while, she could be a “best-selling author. ”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>When I first came out with my first book If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, 
Don’t Go to School? a publisher suggested I change the tide to The Economics of Education. I 
told the publisher that with a title like that, I would sell two books: one to my family and one to 
my best friend. The problem is, they would expect it for free. The obnoxious title If You Want 
To Be Rich and Happy, Don’t Go to School? was chosen because we knew it would get tons of 
publicity. I am pro-education and believe in education reform. Otherwise, why would I continue 
to press for changing our antiquated educational system? So I chose a title that would get me on 
more TV and radio shows, simply because I was willing to be controversial. Many people 
thought I was a fruitcake, but the book sold and sold.</p> <div class=’story_text’>When I 
graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1969, my educated dad was happy. 
Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-tanker fleet. I was a third mate, and the pay 
was low compared with my classmates, but it was OK for a first real job after college. My starting 
pay was about $42,000 a year, including overtime, and I only had , to work for seven months. I 
had five months of vacation. If I had wanted to, I could have taken the run to Vietnam with a 
subsidiary shipping company, and easily doubled my pay instead of taking the five J months’ 
vacation. </p> <div class=’story_text’>I had a great career ahead of me, yet I resigned after six 
months with the company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly. My educated dad 
was devastated. Rich dad congratulated me.</p> <div class=’story_text’>In school and in the 
workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of “specialization.” That is, in order to make more 
money or get promoted, you need to “specialize.” That is why medical doctors immediately 
begin to seek a specialty such as orthopedics or pediatrics. The same is true for accountants, 
architects, lawyers, pilots and others. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad believed in 
the same dogma. That is why he was thrilled when he eventually achieved his doctorate. He 
often admitted ; that schools reward people who study more and more about less and less.</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>Rich dad encouraged me to do exactly the opposite. “You want to

know a little about a lot” was his suggestion. That is why for years I worked in different areas of 
his companies. For awhile, I worked in his accounting department. Although I would probably 
never have been an accountant, he wanted me to learn via “osmosis.” Rich dad knew I would 
pick up “jargon” and a sense of what is important and what is not. I also worked as a bus boy 
and construction worker, as well as in sales, reservations and marketing. He was “grooming” 
Mike and me. That is why he insisted we sit in on the meetings with his bankers, lawyers, 
accountants and brokers. He wanted us to know a little about every aspect of his empire. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>When I quit my high-paying job with Standard Oil, my educated dad had 
a heart-to-heart with me. He was bewildered. He could not understand my decision to resign 
from a career that offered high pay, great benefits, lots of time off, and opportunity for 
promotion. When he asked me one evening, “Why did you quit?” I could not explain it to him, 
as much as I tried. My logic did not fit his logic. The big problem wasthat my logic was my rich 
dad’s logic. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Job security meant everything to my educated dad. 
Learning meant everything to my rich dad.</p> <div class=’story_text’>Educated dad thought I 
went to school to learn to be a ship’s officer. Rich dad knew that I went to school to study 
international trade. So as a student, 1 made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil tankers 
and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich dad emphasized that I stay in 
the Pacific instead of taking ships to Europe because he knew that the “emerging nations” were 
in Asia, not Europe. While most of my classmates, including Mike, were partying at their 
fraternity houses, I was studying trade, people, business styles and cultures in Japan, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Korea, Tahiti, Samoa and the Philippines. I also 
was partying, but it was not in any frat house. I grew up rapidly. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and join the 
Marine Corps. I told him I wanted to learn to fly, but really I wanted to learn to lead troops. Rich 
dad explained to me that the hardest part of running a company is managing people. He had 
spent three years in the Army; my educated dad was draft-exempt. Rich dad told me of the 
value of learning to lead men into dangerous situations. “Leadership is what you need to learn 
next,” he said. “If you’re not a good leader, you’ll get shot in the back, just like they do in 
business. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Returning from Vietnam in 1973,1 resigned my 
commission, even though I loved flying. I found a job with Xerox Corp. I joined it for one 
reason, and it was not for the benefits. I was a shy person, and the thought of selling was the 
most frightening subject in the world. Xerox has one of the best sales-training programs in 
America. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Rich dad was proud of me. My educated dad was 
ashamed. Being an intellectual, he thought that salespeople were below him. I worked with 
Xerox for four years until I overcame my fear of knocking on doors and being rejected. Once I 
could consistently be in the top five in sales, I again resigned and moved on, leaving behind 
another great career with an excellent company. </p> <div class=’story_text’>In 1977,1 formed 
my first company. Rich dad had groomed Mike and me to take over companies. So I now had to 
learn to form them and put them together. My first product, the nylon and velcro wallet, was 
manufactured in the Far East and shipped to a warehouse in New York, near where I had gone 
to school. My formal education was complete, and it was time to test my wings. If I failed, I went 
broke. Rich dad</p> <div class=’story_text’>thought it best to go broke before 30. “You still 
have time to recover” </p> <div class=’story_text’>was his advice. On the eve of my 30th 
birthday, my first shipment left ,,</p> <div class=’story_text’>Korea for New York.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Today, I still do business internationally. And as my rich dad encouraged me 
to do, I keep seeking the emerging nations. Today my investment company invests in South

America, Asia, Norway and Russia. There is an old cliche that goes, “Job is an acronym for ’Just 
Over Broke.’” And unfortunately, I would say that the saying applies to millions of people. 
Because school does not think financial intelligence is an intelligence, most workers “live within 
their means.” They work and they pay the bills. </p> <div class=’story_text’>There is another 
horrible management theory that goes, “Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners 
pay just enough so that workers won’t quit.” And if you look at the pay scales of most 
companies, again I would say there is a degree of truth in that statement. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The net result is that most workers never get ahead. They do what they’ve 
been taught to do: “Get a secure job.” Most workers focus on working for pay and benefits that 
reward them in the short term, but is often disastrous in the long. Instead I recommend to young 
people to seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down the 
road at what ; skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before 
getting trapped in the “Rat Race.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Once people are trapped in the 
lifelong process of bill paying, they 1 become like those little hamsters running around in those 
little metal wheels. Their little furry legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is turning furiously, but 
come tomorrow morning, they’ll still be in the same cage: great job.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In the movie Jerry Maguire, starring Tom Cruise, there are many great one 
liners. Probably the most memorable is “Show me the money.” But there is one line I thought 
most truthful. It comes from the scene where Tom Cruise is leaving the firm. He has just been 
fired, and he is asking the entire company “Who wants to come with me?” And the whole place 

is silent and frozen. Only one woman speaks up and says, “I’d like to but I’m due for a 

promotion in three months. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>That statement is probably the most 
truthful statement in the whole movie. It is the type of statement that people use to keep 
themselves</p> <div class=’story_text’>busy working away to pay bills. I know my educated 
dad looked forward to his pay raise every year, and every year he was disappointed. So he 
would go back to school to earn more qualifications so he could get another raise, but again, it 
would be another disappointment. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The question I often ask people 
is, “Where is this daily activity taking you?” Just like the little hamster, I wonder if people look at 

where their hard work is taking them. What does the future hold?</p> <div 

class=’story_text’>Cyril Brickfield, the former executive director of The American Association of 
Retired People, reports that “private pensions are in a state of chaos. First of all, 50 percent of 
the workforce today has no pension. That alone should be of great concern. And 75 to 80 
percent of the other 50 percent have ineffective pensions that pay $55 or $150 or $300 a 
month. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>In his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: 
“I visited the headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met with a managing 
director who specializes in designing lush retirement plans for top management. When I asked 
her what people who don’t have corner offices will be able to expect in the way of pension 
income, she said with a confident smile: ’’The Silver Bullet. ’</p> <div class=’story_text’>" 
’What,’ I asked, ’is The Silver Bullet?’</p> <div class=’story_text’>“She shrugged, ’If baby 
boomers discover they don’t have enough money to live on when they’re older, they can always 
blow their brains out.’” Karpel goes on to explain the difference between the old Defined 
Benefit retirement plans and the new 401K plans which are riskier. It is not a pretty picture for 
most people working today. And that is just for retirement. When medical fees and long-term 
nursing home care are added to the picture, the picture is frightening. In his 1995 book, he 
indicates that nursing-home fees run from $30,000 to $125,000 per year. He went to a clean 
no-frills nursing home in his area and found the price to be $88,000 a year in 1995. </p> <div

class=’story_text’>Already, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine need to make 
tough decisions such as “Who will live and who will die?” They make those decisions purely on 
how much money they have and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will 
give the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient gets put to the back of the 
line. So just as the rich can afford better education, the rich will be able to keep themselves 
alive, while those who have little wealth will die.</p> <div class=’story_text’>So I wonder, are 
workers looking into the future or just until their next paycheck, never questioning where they 
are headed?</p> <div class =’story_text’> When I speak to adults who want to earn more 
money, I always recommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life. Instead of 
simply working for the money and security, which I admit are important, I suggest they take a 
second job that will teach them a second skill. Often 1 recommend joining a network marketing 
company, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales skills. Some of these 
companies have excellent training programs that help people get over their fear of failure and 
rejection, which are the main reasons people /) are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable 
than money, in the long run.</p> <div class=’story_text’>When I offer this suggestion, I often 
hear in response, “Oh that is too much hassle,” or “I only want to do what I am interested 
in.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>To the statement of “It’s too much of a hassle,” I ask, “So you 
would ; rather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the government’” To the 
other statement-“I only do what I am interested in”-l say, “I’m not interested in going to the 
gym, but I go because I want to feel better and live longer. ”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Unfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement “You can’t teach an 
old dog new tricks.” Unless a person is used to changing, it’s hard to change. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>But for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes to the idea of 
working to learn something new, I offer this word of encouragement: Life is much like going to 
the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There have 
been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a 
pleasure. After the workout is over, I am always glad I talked myself into going. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>lf you are unwilling to work to learn something new and insist on, instead, 
becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the company you work for is unionized. 
Labor unions are designed to protect specialists. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad, 
after falling from grace with the governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He 
told me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the other hand, spent his life 
doing his best to keep his companies from becoming unionized. He was successful. Although 
the unions came close, rich dad was always able to fight them off.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and the benefits of 
both sides. If you do as school recommends, become highly specialized, then seek union 
protection. Lor example, had I continued on with my flying career, I would have sought a 
company that had a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated to learn a 
skill that was valuable in only one industry. If 1 were pushed out of that industry, my life’s skills 
would not be as valuable to another industry. A displaced senior pilot-with 100,000 hours of 
heavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year-would have a hard time finding an 
equivalent high-paying job in school teaching. The skills do not necessarily transfer from industry 
to industry, because the skills the pilots are paid for in the airline industry are not as important 
in, say, the school system. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The same is true even for doctors today. 
With all the changes in medicine, many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical 
organizations such as HMO’s. Schoolteachers definitely need to be union members. Today in

America, the teachers union is the largest and the richest labor union of all. The NEA, National 
Education Association, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the protection of their 
union because their skills are also of limited value to an industry outside of education. So the rule 
of thumb is, “Highly specialized, then unionize.” It’s the smart thing to do.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>When I ask the classes I teach, “How many of you can cook a better 
hamburger than McDonald’s?” almost all the students raise their hands. I then ask, “So if most 
of you can cook a better hamburger, how come McDonald’s makes more money than 
you?”</p> <div class =’story_text’>The answer is obvious: McDonald’s is excellent at business 
systems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a 
better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of 
money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him that she had left him $35,000. That is 
what was left of her estate after the attorney and the government took their shares. 
Immediately, he saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this money to 
advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine 
that targeted the very rich. The ad ran for three months. He received no replies from the ad, 
and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for 
misrepresentation. </p> <div class=’story_text’>This is a common case of someone who can 
build a beautiful hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned, 
his only reply was that “advertising salespeople are crooks.” I then asked him if he would be 
willing to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the 
time, and I don’t want to waste my money. ”</p> <div class =’story_text’>The world is filled with 
talented poor people. All too often, they’re poor or struggle financially or earn less than they 
are capable of, not f because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They 
focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and 
delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald’s does not make the best hamburger, but they are 
the best at f selling and delivering a basic average burger. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Poor dad 
wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to be paid more. Even after being told by 
the governor of Hawaii that he could no longer work in state government, my educated dad 
continued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad then took up the cause of the 
teachers union, campaigning for further protection and benefits for I these highly skilled and 
educated professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that overspecialization is 
what caused the need for union protection. He never understood that the more specialized you 
become, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Rich dad advised that Mike and I “groom” ourselves. Many corporations do 
the same thing. They find a young bright student out of business school and begin “grooming” 
that person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not 
specialize in one department; they are moved from department to department to learn all the 
aspects of business systems. The rich often “groom” their children or the children of others. By 
doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the 
various departments interrelate.</p> <div class=’story_text’>For the World War II generation, it 
was considered “bad” to skip from company to company. Today, it is considered smart. Since 
people will skip from company to company, rather than seek greater specialization, why not 
seek to “learn” more than “earn.” In the short term, it may earn you less. In the long term, it 
will pay off in large dividends. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The main management skills needed 
for success are:</p> <div class=’story_text’>l.D The management of cash flow</p> <div 


Page 75/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


class='story_text'>2.n The management of systems (including yourself and time with 
family). </p> <div class='story_text>3. The management of people. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing. 
It is the ability to sell--therefore, to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, 
employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill of personal success. It is communication 
skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that 
I work on constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my 
knowledge. </p> <div class=’story_text’>As 1 have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder 
and harder the more competent he became. He also became more trapped the more 
specialized he got. Although his salary went up, his choices diminished. Soon after he was 
locked out of government work, he found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. It is 
like professional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play. Their once high-paying 
position is gone, and they have limited skills to fall back on. I think that is why my educated dad 
sided so much with unions after that. He realized how much a union would have benefited 
him.</p> <div class=’story_text’>Rich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot. 
He encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to bring smart people 
together to work as a team. Today it would be called a synergy of professional specialities. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year. They earn that much because they have specialized skills in their field as well as 
other skills. They can teach as well as sell and market. I know of no other skills to be more 
important than selling as well as marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for 
most people primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better you are at communicating, 
negotiating and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that 
newspaper writer who wanted to become a “best-selling author,” I advise anyone else today. 
Being technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses. I have friends who are 
geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with other human beings and, as a result, 
their earnings are pitiful. I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn 
nothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be good 
teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to 
receive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and 
receiving. I know many people who are poor because they are neither good students nor good 
teachers. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a 
practice to give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more 
they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave lots of 
money away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He knew that to receive 
money, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families. That 
is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These 
are organizations designed to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in 
perpetuity. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad always said, “When 1 have some extra 
money, I’ll give it.” The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw 
more money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: “Give and you shall 
receive.” Instead, he believed in “Receive and then you give.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>In 
conclusion, I became both dads. One part of me is a hard-core capitalist who loves the game of 
money making money. The other side is a socially responsible teacher who is deeply 
concerned with this ever-widening gap between the haves and have nots. I personally hold the

CHAPTER EIGHT 


Overcoming Obstacles 

Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may still face roadblocks to 
becoming financially independent. There are five main reasons why financially literate people 
may still not develop abundant asset columns. Asset columns that could produce large sums of 
cash flow. Asset columns that could free them to live the life they dream of, instead of working 
full time just to pay bills. The five reasons are: 

1. D Fear. 

2 . D Cynicism. 

3. D Laziness. 

4. D Bad habits. 

5. D Arrogance. 

Reason No. 1. Overcoming the fear of losing money. I have never met anyone who really likes 
losing money. And in all my years, I have never met a rich person who has never lost money. 
But I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime. . .investing, that is. 

The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it’s not fear that is the 
problem. It’s how you handle fear. It’s how you handle losing. It’s how you handle failure that 
makes the difference in one’s life. That goes for anything in life, not just money. The primary 
difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they handle that fear. 

It’s OK to be fearful. It’s OK to be a coward when it comes to money. You can still be rich. 
We’re all heroes at something and cowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency 
room nurse. When ; she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention investing, she runs’j 
away. When I see blood, I don’t run. I pass out. My rich dad understood phobias about money. 
“Some people are terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both are 
phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing money was this little rhyme: “If 
you hate risk and worry. . .start early.” 

That’s why banks recommend savings as a habit when you’re young. J If you start young, it’s 
easy to be rich. I won’t go into it here, but there is a large difference between a person who 
starts saving at age 20 versus age 30. A staggering difference. 

It is said that one of the wonders of the world is the power of compound interest. The purchase 
of Manhattan Island is said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was 
purchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet, if that $24 had been invested, at 8 percent 
annually, that $24 would have been worth more than $28 trillion by 1995, Manhattan could be 
repurchased with money left over to buy much of L.A., especially at 1995’s real estate prices.

My neighbor works for a major computer company. He has been there 25 years. In five more 
years he will leave the company with $4 million in his 401k retirement plan. It is invested mostly 
in high-growth mutual funds, which he will convert to bonds and government securities. He’ll 
only be 55 when he gets out, and he will have -a passive cash flow of over $300,000 a year, 
more than he makes from his salary. So it can be done, even if you hate losing or hate risk. But 
you must start early and definitely set up a retirement plan, and you should hire a financial 
planner you trust to guide you before investing in anything. 

But what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire early? How do you handle the 
fear of losing money? 

My poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing to discuss the subject. 

My rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think like a Texan. “I like Texas and 
Texans,” he used to say. “In Texas, everything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And 
when they lose, it’s spectacular.” 

“They like losing?” I asked. 

“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy loser, and I’ll show you a 
loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude toward risk, reward and failure I’m talking about. It’s 
how they handle life. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living like 
roaches when it comes to money. Roaches terrified that someone will shine a light on them. 
Whimpering when the grocery clerk short changes them a quarter.” 

Rich dad went on to explain. 

“What I like best is the Texas attitude. They’re proud when they win, and they brag when they 
lose. Texans have a saying, "If you’re going to go broke, go big. You don’t want to admit you 
went broke over a duplex. Most people around here are so afraid of losing, they don’t have a 
duplex to go broke with. 1 ' 

He constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack of financial success was 
because most people played it too safe. “People are so afraid of losing that they lose” were his 
words. 

Fran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still another way: “Winning means 
being unafraid to lose.” In my own life, I’ve noticed that winning usually follows losing. Before I 
finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times. I’ve never met a 

golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I’ve never met people who have fallen in love who have 
never had their heart broken. And I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money. 

So for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is 
far greater than the joy of being rich. Another saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to 
Heaven, but no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are terrified of losing 
money. So they never get to Heaven. 

Rich dad used to tell Mike and me stories about his trips to Texas. “If you really want to learn 
the attitude of how to handle risk, losing and failure, go to San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The 


Page 79/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


Alamo is a great story of brave people who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of 
success against overwhelming odds. They chose to die instead of surrendering. It’s an inspiring 
story worthy of study; nonetheless, it’s still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts kicked. A 
failure if you will. They lost. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, ’Remember the 
Alamo!”’ 

Mike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when f he was about to go into a 
big deal and he was nervous. After he had done all his due diligence and now it was put up or 
shut up, he told us this story. Every time he was afraid of making a mistake, or losing money, he 
told us this story. It gave him strength, for it reminded him that he could always turn a financial 
loss into a financial win. Rich dad I knew that failure would only make him stronger and smarter. 
It’s not that! he wanted to lose; he just knew who he was and how he would take a loss. He 
would take a loss and make it a win. That’s what made him a winner and others losers. It gave 
him the courage to cross the line when others backed out. “That’s why I like Texans so much. 
They took a great failure and turned it into a tourist destination that makes them millions.” 

But probably his words that mean the most to me today are these: “Texans don’t bury their 
failures. They get inspired by them. They take i their failures and turn them into rallying cries. 
Failure inspires Texans to ’ become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. 
It j is the formula for all winners.” 

Just as I also said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. I remember falling off only 
made me more determined to learn to ride. Not less. I also said that I have never met a golfer 
who has never lost a ball. To be a top professional golfer, losing a ball or a tournament only 
inspires golfers to be better, to practice harder, to study more. That’s what makes them better. 
For winners, losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them. 

Quoting John D. Rockefeller, “I always tried to turn every disaster ’ into an opportunity.” 

And being Japanese-American, I can say this. Many people say that Pearl Harbor was an 
American mistake. I say it was a Japanese mistake. From the movie Tora, Tora, Tom, a somber 
Japanese admiral says to his cheering subordinates, “I am afraid we have awakened a sleeping 
giant.” “Remember Pearl Harbor” became a rallying cry. It turned one of America’s greatest 
losses into the reason to win. This great defeat gave America strength, and America soon 
emerged as a world power. 

Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest secret of winners. It’s the 
secret that losers do not know. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; 
thus, they’re not afraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton’s quote, “Winning means being 
unafraid to lose.” People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of losing because they know who 
they are. They hate losing, so they know that losing will only inspire them to become better. 
There is a big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most people are so 
afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke over a duplex. Financially they play life too 
safe and too small. They buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. The main reason 
that over 90 percent of the American public struggles financially is because they play not to 
lose. They don’t play to win. 

They go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers and buy a balanced portfolio. 


Page 80/114

Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield bonds, mutual funds that can be traded within a mutual- 
fund family, and a few individual stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is not a winning 
portfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose. 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s probably a better portfolio than more than 70 percent of the 
population, and that’s frightening. Because a safe portfolio is a lot better than no portfolio. It’s a 
great portfolio for someone who loves safely. But playing it safe and going “balanced” on your 
investment portfolio is not the way successful investors play the game. If you have little money 
and you want to be rich, you must first be “focused,” not “balanced.” If you look at anyone 
successful, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one 
spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress 
walking. 

Thomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was not balanced. He was 
focused. Donald Trump is focused. George Soros is focused. George Patton did not take his 
tanks wide. He focused them and blew through the weak spots in the German line. The French 
went wide with the Maginot Line, and you know what happened to them. 

If you have any desire of being rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Do 
not do what poor and middle class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets. 

If you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it safe. Go with balanced 
investments. If you’re over 25 years old and are terrified of taking risks, don’t change. Play it 
safe, but start early. Start accumulating your nest egg early because it will take time. 

But if you have dreams of freedom-of getting out of the rat race- the first question to ask 
yourself is, “How do I respond to failure?” If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for 
it-but only maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper tantrums-like spoiled 
brats who call an attorney to file a lawsuit every time something does not go their way-then play 
it safe. Keep your daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk in 
those financial instruments also, even though they are safer. 

I say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because stacking the asset column is easy. 
It’s really a low-aptitude game. It doesn’t take much education. Fifth-grade math will do. But 
staking the asset column ’J is a high-attitude game. It takes guts, patience and a great attitude 
toward failure. Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners.” Just remember the 
Alamo. 

Reason No. 2. Overcoming cynicism. “The sky is falling. The sky is falling.” Most of us know the 
story of “Chicken Little,” who ran around warning the barnyard of impending doom. We all 
know people who are that way. But we all have a “Chicken Little” inside each of us. 

And as I stated earlier, the cynic is really a little chicken. We all get a little chicken when fear 
and doubt cloud our thoughts. 

All of us have doubts. “I’m not smart.” “I’m not good enough.” “So ’$ and so is better than me.” 
Or our doubts often paralyze us. We play the. I “What if?” game. “What if the economy 
crashes right after I invest?” Or “What if I lose control and I can’t pay the money back?” “What 
if things don’t go as I planned?” Or we have friends or loved ones who will remind us of our 


Page 81/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


shortcomings regardless of whether we ask. They often say, “What makes you think you can do 
that?” Or “If it’s such a good idea, how come someone else hasn’t done it?” Or “That will never 
work. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” These words of doubt often get so loud that 
we fail to act. A horrible feeling builds in our stomach. Sometimes we can’t sleep. We fail to 
move forward. So we stay with what is safe and opportunities pass us by. We watch life passing 
by as we sit immobilized with a cold knot in our body. We have all felt this at one time in our 
lives, some more than others. 

Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan mutual fund fame refers to warnings about the sky falling as 
“noise,” and we all hear it. 

“Noise” is either created inside our heads or comes from outside. Often from friends, family, co- 
workers and the media. Lynch recalls the time during the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war 
was so prevalent in the news that people began building fallout shelters and storing food and 
water. If they had invested that money wisely in the market, instead of building a fallout shelter, 
they’d probably be financially independent today. 

When the riots broke out in Los Angeles a few years ago, gun sales went up all over the 
country. A person dies from rare hamburger meat in Washington State and the Arizona Health 
Department orders restaurants to have all beef cooked well-done. A drug company runs a 
national TV commercial showing people catching the flu. The ad runs in February. Colds go up 
as well as sales of their cold medicine. 

Most people are poor because when it comes to investing, the world is filled with Chicken Littles 
running around yelling, “The sky is falling. The sky is falling.” And Chicken Littles are effective 
because everyone of us is a little chicken. It often takes great courage to not let rumors and talk 
of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears. 

In 1992, a friend named Richard came from Boston to visit my wife and me in Phoenix. He was 
impressed with what we had done through stocks and real estate. The prices of real estate in 
Phoenix were depressed. We spent two days with him showing him what we thought were 
excellent opportunities for cash flow and capital appreciation. 

My wife and I are not real estate agents. We are strictly investors. After identifying a unit in a 
resort community, we called an agent who sold it to him that afternoon. The price was a mere 
$42,000 for a two-bedroom townhome. Similar units were going for $65,000. He had found a 
bargain. Excited, he bought it and returned to Boston. 

Two weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed out. I called immediately to 
find out why. All he said was that he talked to his neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a 
bad deal. He was paying too much. 

I asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor. Richard said “no.” When I asked why he listened 
to him, Richard got defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking. 

The real estate market in Phoenix turned, and by 1994, that little unit was renting for $1,000 a 
month-$2,500 in the peak winter months. The unit was worth $95,000 in 1995. All Richard 
had to put down was $5,000 and he would have had a start at getting out of the rat race. 
Today, he still has done nothing. And the bargains in Phoenix are still here; you just have to 


Page 82/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


look a lot harder. 

Richard’s backing out did not surprise me. It’s called “buyer’s remorse,” and it affects all of us. 
It’s those doubts that get us. The little 1 chicken won, and a chance at freedom was lost. 

In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in tax lien certificates instead of CDs. I 
earn 16 percent per year on my money, which certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers. 
The certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than 
most banks. The formula they’re bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look 
at them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they have money in 
CDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it’s risky. They tell me why I should not do 
it. When I ask them where they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment 
magazine. They’ve never done it, and they’re telling someone who’s doing it why they 
shouldn’t. The lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent, but people who are filled with doubt are 
willing to accept 5 percent. Doubt is expensive. 

My point is that it’s those doubts and cynicism that keep most people? poor and playing it safe. 
The real world is simply waiting for you to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor. As I 
said, getting out of the rat race is technically easy. It doesn’t take much education, but those 
doubts are cripple rs for most people. 

“Cynics never win,” said rich dad. “Unchecked doubt and fear creates i a cynic. Cynics criticize, 
and winners analyze” was another of his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism 
blinded while analysis opened -< eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were blind, 
and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding what people miss is I key to 
any success. 

Real estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking financial independence or 
freedom. It is a unique investment tool. Yet, every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I 
often hear, “I don’t want to fix toilets.” 

That’s what Peter Lynch calls “noise.” That’s what my rich dad would say is the cynic talking. 
Someone who criticizes and does not 

analyze. Someone who lets their doubts and fears close their mind instead of open their eyes.” 

So when someone says, “I don’t want to fix toilets,” I want to fire back, “What makes you think I 
want to?” They’re saying a toilet is more important than what they want. I talk about freedom 
from the rat race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that keeps most people 
poor. They criticize instead of analyze. 

’I don’t wants’ hold the key to your success,” rich dad would say. 

Because I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property manager who does fix 
toilets. And by finding a great property manager who runs houses or apartments, well, my cash 
flow goes up. But more importantly a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real 
estate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to success in real estate. 
Finding a good manager is more important to me than the real estate. A great property 
manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes them even more

valuable . 

That is what rich dad meant by “ I don’t wants’ hold the key to your success.” Because I do not 
want to fix toilets either, I figured out how to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out 
of the rat race. The people who continue to say “I don’t want to fix toilets” often deny 
themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are more important than their 
freedom. 

In the stock market, I often hear people say, "I don’t want to lose money.” Well, what makes 
them think I or anyone else likes losing money? They don’t make money because they chose to 
not lose money. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful investment 
vehicle, the stock market. 

In December 1996,1 was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He looked up 
and saw that the price of oil was going up. My friend is a worry wart or a “Chicken Little.” To 
him, the sky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him. 

When we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the price of oil was going to go up 
over the next few years. Statistics I had never seen before, even though I already owned a 
substantial share block of an existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began 
looking for and found a new undervalued oil company that was about to find some oil deposits. 
My broker was excited about this new company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per 
share . 

In February 1997, this same friend and I drove by the same gas station, and sure enough, the 
price per gallon had gone up nearly 15 percent. Again, the “Chicken Little” worried and 
complained. I smiled because in January 1997, that little oil company hit oil and those 15,000 
shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had first given me the tip. And the price of 
gas will continue to go up if what my friend says is true. 

Instead of analyzing, their little chicken closes their mind. If most people understood how a 
“stop” worked in stock-market investing, there would be more people -investing to win instead 
of investing not to lose. A “stop” is simply a computer command that sells your stock 
automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to minimize your losses and maximize some 
gains. It’s a great tool for those who are terrified of losing. 

So whenever I hear people focusing on their “I don’t wants,” rather than what they do want, I 
know the “noise” in their head must be loud. Chicken Little has taken over their brain and is 
yelling, “The sky is falling and toilets are breaking.” So they avoid their “don’t wants,” but they 
pay a huge price. They may never get what they want in life. 

Rich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. “Just do what Colonel Sanders did.” At the 
age of 66, he lost his business and began to live on his Social Security check. It wasn’t enough. 
He went around, the country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down 1,009 
times before someone said “yes.” And he went on to become a 

multimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. “He was a brave and tenacious man,” 
rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.

So when you’re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Col. Sanders did to his little 
chicken. He fried it. 

Reason No. 3. Laziness. Busy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a 
businessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a good provider for his wife 
and children. He spends long hours at the office and brings work home on weekends. One day 
he comes home to an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and his wife 
had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship strong, he stayed busy at work. 
Dismayed, his performance at work slips and he loses his job. 

Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth. And there are people 
too busy to take care of their health. The cause is the same. They’re busy, and they stay busy as 
a way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down 
they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with anger or irritation. 

If they aren’t busy at work or with the kids, they’re often busy watching TV, fishing, playing golf 
or shopping. Yet, deep down they know they are avoiding something important. That’s the 
most common form of laziness. Laziness by staying busy. 

So what is the cure for laziness? The answer is a little greed. 

For many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. “Greedy people are bad 
people,” my mom use to say. Yet, we all have inside of us this yearning to have nice things, 
new things or exciting things. So to keep that emotion of desire under control, often parents 
found ways of suppressing that desire with guilt. 

“You only think about yourself. Don’t you know you have brothers and sisters?” was one of my 
mom’s favorites. Or “You want me to buy you what?” was a favorite of my dad. “Do you think 
we’re made of money? Do you think money grows on trees? We’re not rich people, you know.” 

It wasn’t so much the words but the angry guilt-trip that went with the words that got to me. 

Or the reverse guilt-trip was the “I’m sacrificing my life to buy this for you. I’m buying this for 
you because I never had this advantage when I was a kid.” I have a neighbor who is stone broke, 
but can’t park his car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those spoiled brats 
get everything they ask for. "1 don’t want them to know the feeling of want” are his everyday 
words. He has nothing set aside for their college or his retirement, but his kids have every toy 
ever made. He recently got a new credit card in the mail and took his kids to visit Las Vegas. 
“I’m doing it for the kids,” he said with great sacrifice. 

Rich dad forbade the words “I can’t afford it.” 

In my real home, that’s all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his children to say, “How can I 
afford it?” His reasoning, the words “1 can’t afford it” shut down your brain. It didn’t have to 
think anymore. “How can I afford it’” opened up the brain. Forced it to think and search for 
answers. 

But most importantly, he felt the words “I can’t afford it” were a lie. And the human spirit knew 
it. “The human spirit is very, very, powerful,” he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By 
having a lazy mind that says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you. Your spirit is angry, 


Page 85/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


and your lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is screaming, “Come on. Let’s go to the gym 
and work out.” And the lazy mind says, “But I’m tired. I worked really hard today.” Or the 
human spirit says, “I’m sick and tired of being poor. Let’s get out there and get rich.” To which 
the lazy mind says, "Rich people are greedy. Besides it’s too much bother. 

It’s not safe. I might lose money. I’m working hard enough as it is. I’ve got too much to do at 
work anyway. Look at what I have to do tonight. My boss wants it finished by the morning." 

“I can’t afford it” also brings up sadness. A helplessness that leads to ’ despondency and often 
depression. “Apathy” is another word. “How can I afford it?” opens up possibilities, excitement 
and dreams. So rich dad , was not so concerned about what you wanted to buy, but that “How 
can ’f j I afford it?” created a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit. 

Thus, he rarely gave Mike or me anything. Instead he would ask, “How can you afford it?” and 
that included college, which we paid for ourselves. It was not the goal but the process of 
attaining the goal we desired that he wanted us to learn. The problem I sense today is that there 
are millions of people who feel guilty about their greed. It’s an old conditioning from their 
childhood. Their desire to have the finer things that life offers. Most have been conditioned 
subconsciously to say, “You can’t have that,” or ; 

“You’ll never afford that.” 

When I decided to exit the rat race, it was simply a question. “How can I afford to never work 
again?” And my mind began to kick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my 
real parents’ dogma of “We can’t afford that.” Or “Stop thinking only about yourself.” Or “Why 
don’t you think about others?” and other such words designed to instill guilt to suppress my 
greed. 

So how do you beat laziness? The answer is a little greed. It’s that radio station WII-FM, which 
stands for “What’s In It-For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What’s in it for me if I’m 
healthy, sexy and good looking?” Or “What would my life be like if I never had to work again?” 
Or “What would I do if I had all the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to 
have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a 
better life. New inventions are made because we desire something better. We go to school and 
study hard because we want something better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding 
something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is “What’s in it for 
me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness. 

Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. But just remember what 
Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street. “Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: 
"Guilt is worse than greed. 

For guilt robs the body of its soul.“ And to me, Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: ”Do what you feel 
in your heart to be right-for you’ll be criticized anyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned 
if you don’t." 

Reason No. 4. Habits. Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education. After 
seeing the movie Conan, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, a friend said, “I’d love to have a body 
like Schwarzenegger.” Most of the guys nodded in agreement.

“I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time,” another friend added. 

“Yeah, I heard that too,” another one added. “I heard he has a habit of working out almost 
every day in the gym.” 

“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.” 

“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides, let’s stop talking about 
Arnold and get some beers.” 

This is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember asking my rich dad about the 
habits of the rich. Instead of answering me outright, he wanted me to learn through example, as 
usual. 

“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked. 

“The first of the month,” I said. 

“Does he have anything left over?” he asked. 

“Very little,” I said. 

“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has bad habits.” 

“Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but only if he has anything left over.” 

“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t he? You’re saying he 
shouldn’t pay his bills?” 

“Of course not,” said rich dad. “I firmly believe in paying my bills on time. I just pay myself first. 
Before I pay even the government.” 

“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked. “What do you do then?” 

“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m short of money. My asset column 
is far more important to me than the government.” 

“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?” 

“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay. I just said I pay myself 
first, even if I’m short of money.” 

“But,” I replied. “How do you do that’” 

“It’s not how. The question is ’Why,”’ rich dad said. 

“OK, why?” 

“Motivation,” said rich dad “Who do you think will complain louder if I don’t pay them-me or my 
creditors?” 

“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” 1 said, responding to the obvious. “You 
wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t pay yourself.” 


Page 87/114

“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and the other creditors is so 
great that it forces me to seek other forms of income. The pressure to pay becomes my 
motivation. I’ve worked extra jobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, 
anything just to make sure those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me work 
harder, forced me to think, and all in all made me smarter and more active when it comes to 
money. If I had paid myself last, I would have felt no pressure, but I’d be broke.” 

“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money I to that motivates you?” 

“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are big bullies. So are bill 
collectors in general. Most people give into these bullies. They pay them and never pay 
themselves. You know the story of the 96?pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?” 

I nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons in the comic books all the 
time.” 

"Well, most people let the bullies kick sand in their faces. I decided to use the fear of the bully to 
make me stronger. Others get weaker. Forcing myself to think about how to make extra money 
is like going to the gym and working out with weights. The more I work my mental money 
muscles out, the stronger I get. Now, I’m not afraid of those bullies. 

I liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get financially stronger, mentally and 
fiscally.” 

Rich dad nodded. 

“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like bosses, managers, tax 
collectors, bill collectors and landlords push me around all my life. Just because I don’t have 
good money habits.” 

Rich dad nodded. “Just like the 96-pound weakling.” 

Reason No. 5. Arrogance. Arrogance is ego plus ignorance. I “What I know makes me money. 
What I don’t know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. 
Because when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important,” rich dad 
would often tell me. 

I have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance. It often 
happens when I am discussing financial statements with accountants or even other investors. 

They try to bluster their way through the discussion. It is clear to me that they don’t know what 
they’re talking about. They’re not lying, but they are not telling the truth. 

There are many people in the world of money, finances and investments who have absolutely 
no idea what they’re talking about. Most people in the money industry are just spouting off sales 
pitches like used-car salesmen. 

When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in 
the field or find a book on the subject.

CHAPTER NINE 


Getting Started 

I wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but it wasn’t. 

So in response to the question “How do 1 start?” I offer the thought process I go through on a 
day-by-day basis. It really is easy to find great deals. I promise you that. It’s just like riding a bike. 
After a little wobbling, it’s a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it’s the determination 
to get through the wobbling that’s a personal thing. 

To find million-dollar “deals of a lifetime” requires us to call on our financial genius. I believe that 
each of us has a financial genius within us. The problem is, our financial genius lies asleep, 
waiting to be called upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that 
the love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so we can 
work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry 
about our financial future, our company or the government would take care of us when our 
working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the same school system, who 
will end up paying for it. The message is still to work hard, earn money and spend it, and when 
we run short, we can always borrow more. 

Unfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the above dogma, simply because 
it’s easier to find a job and work for money. If you are not one of the masses, I offer you the 
following ten steps to awaken your financial genius. I simply offer you the steps I have 
personally followed. If you want to follow some of them, great. If you don’t, make up your own. 
Your financial genius is smart enough to develop its own list. 

While in Peru, with a gold miner of 45 years, I asked him how he was so confident about finding 
a gold mine. He replied, “There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.” 

And I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and in a day come up with four or five 
great potential deals, while the average person will go out and find nothing. Even looking in the 
same neighborhood. The reason is they have not taken the time to develop their financial 
genius. 

I offer you the following ten steps as a process to develop your God-given powers. Powers only 
you have control over. 

1. I NEED A REASON GREATER THAN REALITY: The power of spirit. If you ask most 
people if they would like to be rich or financially free, they would say “yes.” But then reality sets 
in. The road seems too long with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money and 
hand the excess over to your broker. I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming 
for the U.S Olympic team. The reality was, she had to get up every morning at 4 a.m. to swim 
for three hours before going to school. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. 
She had to study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else. 


Page 89/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


When I asked her what compelled her with such super-human ambition and sacrifice, she simply 
said, “1 do it for myself and the people I love. It’s love that gets me over the hurdles and 
sacrifices.” 

A reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don’t wants.” When people ask me 
what my reason for wanting to be rich is, it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and 
“don’t wants.” 

I will list a few. First the “don’t wants,” for they create the “wants.” I don’t want to work all my 
life. I don’t want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs. 
I don’t like being an employee. 1 hated that my dad always missed my football games because he 
was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the 
government took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass on what he 
worked so hard for when he died. The rich don’t do that. They work hard and pass it on to their 
children. 

Now the wants. I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love. I want to be 
young when I do this. I want to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want 
money to work for me. 

Those are my deep-seated, emotional reasons. What are yours? If they are not strong enough, 
then the reality of the road ahead may be greater than your reasons. I have lost money and 
been set back many times, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up and 
going forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until I was 4? with many learning 
experiences along the way. 

As I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn’t, but it wasn’t hard either. But without a strong 
reason or purpose, anything in life is hard. 

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE READING FURTHER. 
IT WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK. 

2. I CHOOSE DAILY: The power of choice. That is the main reason people want to live in a 
free country. We want the power to choose. 

Financially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the power to choose our future to be 
rich, poor or middle class. Our spending habits reflect who we are. Poor people simply have 
poor spending habits. 

The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing Monopoly constantly. Nobody told me 
Monopoly was only for kids, so I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad 
who pointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So a long time ago, as a 
little boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that all I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real 
assets. My best friend, Mike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose to 
learn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation simply because there 
was no one trained to be a good steward over their assets. 

Most people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, being rich is “too much of 
a hassle.” So they invent sayings that go, “I’m not interested in money.” Or “I’ll never be rich.” 


Page 90/114 


http : / / motsach . info

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


Or “I don’t have to worry, I’m still young.” Or “When I make some money, then I’ll think about 
my future.” Or “My husband/wife handles the finances.” The problem with those statements is 
they rob the person who chooses to 

think such thoughts of two things: one is time, which is your most precious asset, and two is 
learning. Just because you have no money, should not be an excuse to not learn. But that is a 
choice we all make daily, the choice of what we do with our time, our money and what we put 
in our heads. That is the power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and I 
make that choice every day. 

INVEST FIRST IN EDUCATION: In reality, the only real asset you have is your mind, the most 
powerful tool we have dominion over. Just as I said about the power of choice, each of us has 
the choice of what we put in our brain once we’re old enough. You can watch MTV all day, or 
read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial planning. You choose. Most 
people simply buy investments rather than 

first invest in learning about investing. 

A friend of mine, who is a rich woman, recently had her apartment burglarized. The thieves 
took her TV and VCR and left all the books she reads. And we all have that choice. Again, 90 
percent of the population buys TV sets and only about 10 percent buy books on business or 
tapes on investments. 

So what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two days long because I like to 
immerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was watching TV and this guy came on advertising a 
three-day seminar on how to buy real estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course has 
made me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it bought me life. I don’t have 
to work for the rest of my life because of that one course. I go to at least two such courses every 
year. 

I love audio tapes. The reason: I can rewind quickly. I was listening to a tape by Peter Lynch, 
and he said something I completely disagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I 
simply pushed “rewind” and I listened to that five-minute stretch of tape at least twenty times. 
Possibly more. But suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he said. 
It was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of the greatest investors of our 
time. I gained tremendous depth and insight into the vast resources of his education and 
experience. 

The net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I have Peter’s way of looking at the 
same problem or situation. I have two thoughts instead of one. One more way to analyze a 
problem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often say, “How would Peter Lynch do this, or 
Donald Trump or Warren Buffett or George Soros?” The only way I can access their vast mental 
power is to be humble enough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical 
people are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking risks. You see, if you 
learn something new, you are then required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what 
you have learned. 

If you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems. Arrogant people rarely read or 
buy tapes. Why should they? They are the center of the universe.

There are so many “intelligent” people who argue or defend when a new idea clashes with the 
way they think. In this case, their so-called “intelligence” combined with “arrogance” equals 
“ignorance”. Each of us knows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but 
their balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person welcomes new ideas, for 
new ideas can add to the synergy of other accumulated ideas. Listening is more important than 
talking. If that was not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one mouth. Too 
many people think with their mouth instead of listening to absorb new ideas and possibilities. 
They argue instead of asking questions. 

I take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the “Get rich quick” mentality most lottery 
players or casino gamblers have. I may go in and out of stocks, but I am long on education. If 
you want to fly an airplane, I advise taking lessons first. I am always shocked at people who buy 
stocks or real estate, but never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. Just because you bought 
a house or two does not make you an expert at real estate. 

3. CHOOSE FRIENDS CAREFULLY: The power of association. First of all, I do not choose my 
friends by their financial statements. I have friends who have actually taken the vow of poverty 
as well as friends who earn millions every year. The point is I learn from all of them, and I 
consciously make the effort to learn from them. 

Now I will admit that there are people I have actually sought out because they had money. But I 
was not after their money; I was seeking their knowledge. In some cases, these people who had 
money have become dear friends, but not all. 

But there is one distinction that I would like to point out. I’ve noticed that my friends with money 
talk about money. And I do not mean brag. They’re interested in the subject. So I learn from 
them, and they learn from me. My friends, whom I know are in dire straits financially, do not 
like talking about money, business or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So I 
also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what not to do. 

I have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in their short lifetimes. The three 
of them report the same phenomenon: Their friends who have no money have never come to 
them to ask them how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things, or both: 1. a 
loan, or 2. a job. 

A WARNING: Don’t listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and I love them 
dearly, but they are the “Chicken Littles” of life. When it comes to money, especially 
investments, “The sky is always falling.” They can always tell you why something won’t work. 
The problem is, people listen to them, but people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom 
information are also “Chicken Littles.” As that old saying goes, “Chickens of a feather agree 
together.” 

If you watch CNBC, which is a goldmine of investment information, they often have a panel of 
so-called “experts.” One expert will say the market is going to crash, and the other will say it’s 
going to boom. If you’re smart, you listen to both. Keep your mind open because both have 
valid points. Unfortunately, most poor people listen to “Chicken Little.” 

I have had more close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an investment. A few years ago, a 


Page 92/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


friend told me he was excited because he found a 6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I 
earn 16 percent from the state government. The next day he sent me an article about why my 
investment was dangerous. I have received 16 percent for years now, and he still receives 6 
percent. 

I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and be 
willing to not go along with the crowd. For in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up 
late and is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late in most instances. Look 
for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers: “There is always another wave.” People who hurry 
and catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out. 

Smart investors don’t time markets. If they miss a wave, they search 

for the next one and get themselves in position. Why this is hard for most investors is because 
buying what is not popular is frightening to them. Timid investors are like sheep going along 
with the crowd. Or their greed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their profits 
and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not popular. They know their profits 
are made when they buy, not when they sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the 
market. Just like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell. 

It’s all “insider trading.” There are forms of insider trading that are illegal, and there are forms of 
insider trading that are legal. But either way, it’s insider trading. The only distinction is how far 
away from the inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the 
inside is because that is where the money is made. It’s made on information. You want to hear 
about the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust. I’m not saying do it illegally, but 
the sooner you know, the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what 
friends are for. And that is financial intelligence. 

4. MASTER A FORMULA AND THEN LEARN A NEW ONE: The power of learning quickly. 
In order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it’s only held in their head. The 
same is true for making money. That’s why money is often called “dough.” 

Most of us have heard the saying “You are what you eat.” I have a different slant on the same 
saying. I say, “You become what you study.” In other words, be careful what you study and 
learn, because your mind is so powerful that you become what you put in your head. For 
example, if you study cooking, you then tend to cook. You become a cook. If you don’t want to 
be a cook anymore, then you need to study something else. Let’s say, a schoolteacher. After 
studying teaching, you often become a teacher. And so on. Choose what you study carefully. 

When it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic formula they learned in school. 
And that is, work for money. The formula I see that is predominant in the world is that every 
day millions of people get up and go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks, buy 
some mutual funds and go back to work. That is the basic formula, or recipe. 

If you’re tired of what you’re doing, or you’re not making enough, it’s simply a case of changing 
the formula via which you make money. 

Years ago, when I was 26,1 took a weekend class called “How to Buy Real Estate 
Foreclosures.” I learned a formula. The next trick was to have the discipline to actually put into 


Page 93/114 


http : / / motsach . info

action what I had learned. That is where most people stop. For three years, while working for 
Xerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying foreclosures. I’ve made 
several million dollars using that formula, but today, it’s too slow and too many other people are 
doing it. 

So after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas. For many of the classes, I 
did not use the information I learned directly, ’i I but I always learned something new. 

I have attended classes designed for only derivative traders, also a class for commodity option 
traders and a class for Chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a room full of people 
with doctorates in nuclear physics and space science. Yet, I learned a lot that made my stock 
and real estate investing more meaningful and lucrative. Most junior colleges and community 
colleges have classes on financial planning and buying of traditional investments. They are great 
places to start. 

So I always search for a faster formula. That is why, on a fairly regular basis, I make more in a 
day than many people will make in their lifetime. 

Another side note. In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much what you know anymore that 
counts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless. It’s 
priceless in finding faster formulas-recipes, if you will, for making dough. Working hard for 
money is an old formula born in the day of cave men. 

5. PAY YOURSELF FIRST: The power of self-discipline. If you cannot get control of yourself, 
do not try to get rich. You might first want to join the Marine Corps or some religious order so 
you can get control of yourself. It makes no sense to invest, make money and blow it. It is the 
lack of self-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after winning millions. It 
is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who get a raise to immediately go out and buy a 
new car or take a cruise . 

It is difficult to say which of the ten steps is the most important. But of all the steps, this step is 
probably the most difficult to master if it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to 
say that it is the lack of personal self-discipline that is the No. 1 delineating factor between the 
rich, the poor and the middle class. 

Simply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for financial pressure can 
never, and I mean never, be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from my rich dad was that 
“the world will push you around.” The world pushes people around not because other people 
are bullies, but because the individual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack 
internal fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline. 

In the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people to not focus on their product, 
service or widget, but to focus on developing management skills. The three most important 
management skills necessary to start your own business are: 

1. D Management of cash flow. 

2. □ Management of people. 

3. D Management of personal time.

I would say, the skills to manage these three apply to anything, not just entrepreneurs. The 
three matter in the way you live your life as an individual, or as part of a family, a business, a 
charitable organization, a city or a nation. 

Each of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self discipline. I do not take the saying “pay 
yourself first” lightly. 

The Richest Man in Babylon, by George Classen, is where the statement “pay yourself first” 
comes from. Millions of copies have been sold. But while millions of people freely repeat that 
powerful statement, few follow the advice. As I said, financial literacy allows one to read 
numbers, and numbers tell the story. By looking at a person’s income statement and balance 
sheet, I can readily see if people who spout the words “pay yourself first” actually practice what 
they preach. 

A picture is worth a thousand words. So let’s again compare the financial statements of people 
who pay themselves first against someone who doesn’t. 

People who pay themselves first

Study the diagrams and notice if you can pick up some distinctions. Again, it has to do with 
understanding cash flow, which tells the story. Most people look at the numbers and miss the 
story. If you can truly begin to understand the power of cash flow, you will soon realize what is 
wrong with the picture on the next page, or why 90 percent of most people work hard all their 
lives and need government support like Social Security when they are no longer able to work. 

Do you see it? The diagram above reflects the actions of an individual who chooses to pay 
himself first. Each month, they allocate money to their asset column before they pay their 
monthly expenses. Although millions of people have read Classen’s book and understand the 
words “pay yourself first,” in reality they pay themselves last. 

Now I can hear the howls from those of you who sincerely believe in paying your bills first. And I 
can hear all the “responsible” people who pay their bills on time. I am not saying be 
irresponsible and not pay your bills. All I am saying is do what the book says, which is “pay 
yourself first.” And the diagram above is the correct accounting picture of that action. Not the 
one that follows. 

My wife and I have had many bookkeepers and accountants and bankers who have had a major 
problem with this way of looking at “pay yourself first.” The reason is that these financial 
professionals actually do what the masses do, which is pay themselves last. They pay everyone 
else first. 

There have been months in my life, when for whatever reason, cash flow was far less than my 
bills. I still paid myself first. My accountant and bookkeeper screamed in panic. “They’re going 
to come after you. The IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You’re going to ruin your credit rating.” 
“They’ll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first. 

“Why?” you ask. Because that’s what the story The Richest Man In Babylon was all about. The 
power of self-discipline and the power of internal fortitude. “Guts,” in less elegant terms. As my 
rich dad taught me the first month I worked for him, most people allow the world to push them 
around. A bill collector calls and you “pay or else.” So you pay and not pay yourself. A sales 
clerk says, “Oh, just put it on your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you to “go ahead- 
the government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is what the book is really 
about. Having the guts to go against the tide and get rich. You may not be weak, but when it 
comes to money, many people get wimpy. 

I am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don’t have high credit card debt, and doodad 
debt, is because I want to pay myself first. The reason I minimize my income is because I don’t 
want to pay it to the government. That is why, for those of you who have watched the video 
The Secrets of the Rich, my income comes from my asset column, through a Nevada 
corporation. If I work for money, the government takes it. 

Although I pay my bills last, I am financially astute enough to not get into a tough financial 
situation. I don’t like consumer debt. I actually have liabilities that are higher than 99 percent of 
the population, but I don’t pay for them; other people pay for my liabilities. They’re called 


Page 96/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


tenants. So rule No. 1 in paying yourself first is don’t get into debt in the first place. Although I 
pay my bills last, I set it up to have only small unimportant bills, that I will have to pay. 

Secondly, when 1 occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I let the creditors and even 
the government scream. I like it when they get tough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor. 
They inspire me to i go out and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money, 
and let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. My wife and I have excellent 
credit. We just don’t cave into the pressure and spend our savings or liquidate stocks to pay for 
consumer debt. That is not too financially intelligent. 

So the answer is: 

1. D Don’t get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep your expenses low. Build 
up assets first. Then, buy the big house or nice car. Being stuck in the rat race is not intelligent. 

2 . D When you come up short, let the pressure build and don’t dip into your savings or 
investments. Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to come up with new ways of 
making more money and then pay your bills. You will have increased your ability to make more 
money as well as your financial intelligence. ; : So many times I have gotten into financial hot 
water, and used my brain to create more income, while staunchly defending the assets in my 
asset column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I was like a good trooper 
defending the fort, Fort Assets. 

Poor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently called “Dipping into savings.” 
The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills. 

I know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you’re not tough inside, the world will always push you 
around anyway. 

If you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works for you. A good one is to cut 
expenses, put your money in the bank, pay more than your fair share of income tax, buy safe 
mutual funds and take the vow of the average. But this violates the “pay yourself first” rule. 

The rule does not encourage self-sacrifice or financial abstinence. It doesn’t mean pay yourself 
first and starve. Life was meant to be enjoyed. If you call on your financial genius, you can have 
all the goodies of life, get rich and pay bills, without sacrificing the good life. And that is financial 
intelligence. 

6. PAY YOUR BROKERS WELL: The power of good advice. I often see people posting a sign 
in front of their house that says, “For Sale by Owner.” Or I see on TV today many people 
claiming to be “Discount Brokers.” 

My rich dad taught me to take the opposite tack. He believed in paying professionals well, and I 
have adopted that policy also. Today, I have expensive attorneys, accountants, real estate 
brokers and stockbrokers. Why? Because if, and I do mean if, the people are professionals, their 
services should make you money. And the more money they make, the more money I make. 

We live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good broker should provide you with 
information as well as take the time to educate you. I have several brokers who are willing to do 
that for me. Some taught me when I had little or no money, and I am still with them today. 


Page 97/114

What I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of money I can make because of the 
information they provide. I love it when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of 
money. Because it usually means 1 made a lot of money. 

A good broker saves me time in addition to making me money-as when I bought the piece of 
vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately for over $25,000, so I could buy my Porsche 
quicker. 

A broker is your eyes and ears to the market. They’re there every day so I do not have to be. I'd 
rather play golf. 

Also, people who sell their house on their own must not value their time much. Why would I 
want to save a few bucks when I could use that time to make more money or spend it with those 
I love? What I find funny is that so many poor and middle class people insist on tipping 
restaurant help 15 to 20 percent even for bad service and complain about paying a broker 3 to 
7 percent. They enjoy tipping people in the 

expense column and stiffing people in the asset column. That is not financially intelligent. 

All brokers are not created equal. Unfortunately, most brokers are only salespeople. I would say 
the real estate salespeople are the worst. 

They sell, but they themselves own little or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference 
between a broker who sells houses and a broker who sells investments. And that is true for 
stock, bond, mutual fund and insurance brokers who call themselves financial planners. As in the 
fairy tale, you kiss a lot of frogs to find one prince. Just remember the old saying, “Never ask an 
encyclopedia salesperson if you need an encyclopedia.” 

When I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much property or stocks they 
personally own and what percentage they pay in taxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as 
well as my accountant. I have an accountant who minds her own business. Her profession is 
accounting, but her business is real estate. I used to have an accountant that was a small 
business accountant, but he had no real estate. I switched because we did not love the same 
business. 

Find a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will spend the time 
educating you, and they could be the best asset you find. Just be fair, and most of them will be 
fair to you. If all you can think about is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to 
be around you? It’s just simple logic. 

As I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management of people. Many people only 
manage people they feel smarter than and they have power over, such as subordinates in a 
work situation. Many middle managers remain middle managers, failing to get promoted 
because they know how to work with people below them, but not with people above them. The 
real skill is to manage and pay well the people who are smarter than you in some technical area. 
That is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one, too. And that is 
financial intelligence. 

7. BE AN “INDIAN GIVER”: This is the power of getting something for nothing. When the first 


Page 98/114

white settlers came to America, they were taken aback by a cultural practice some American 
Indians had. For example, if a settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. 
Mistaking it for a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back. 

The Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not want to give it back. That is 
where the term “Indian giver” came from. A simple cultural misunderstanding. 

In the world of the “asset column,” being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated 
investor’s first question is, “How fast do I get my money back?” They also want to know what 
they get for free, also called a piece of the action. That is why the ROI, or return of and on 
investment, is so important. 

For example, I found a small condominium, a few blocks from where I live, that was in 
foreclosure. The bank wanted $60,000, and I submitted a bid for $50,000, which they took, 
simply because, along with my bid, was a cashier’s check for $50,000. They realized I was 
serious. Most investors would say, aren’t you tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be better to get 
a loan on it? The answer is, not in this case. My investment company uses this as a vacation 
rental in the winter months, when the “snowbirds” come to Arizona, and rent it for $2,500 a 
month for four months out of the year. For rental during the off?season, it rents for only $1,000 
a month. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this asset, which pumps money 
out for me, month in and month out. 

The same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker will call me and recommend I move a 
sizable amount of money into the stock of a company that he feels is just about to make a move 
that will add value to the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money in for a 
week to a month while the stock moves up. Then, I pull my initial dollar amount out, and stop 
worrying about the fluctuations of the market, because my initial money is back and ready to 
work on another asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own an asset that 
was technically free. 

True, I have lost money on many occasions. But I only play with money I can afford to lose. I 
would say, on an average ten investments, I hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do 
nothing, and I lose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in at that 
time. 

For people who hate risk, they put their money in the bank. And in the long run, savings are 
better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get your money back and, in most instances, 
you don’t get anything for free with it. They used to hand out toasters, but they rarely do that 
these days. 

On every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something for free. A condominium, 
a mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house, stock shares, office building. And there must be 
limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted entirely to this subject that I will not get 
into here. Ray Kroc, of McDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved 
hamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate ; under the franchise for free. 

So wise investors must look at more than ROI; it’s the assets you get for free once you get your 
money back. That is financial intelligence. :

8. ASSETS BUY LUXURIES: The power of focus. A friend’s child has been developing a nasty 
habit of burning a hole in his pocket. Just 16, he naturally wanted his own car. The excuse, “All 
his friends’ parents gave their kids cars.” The child wanted to go into I 

his savings and use it for a down payment. That was when his father called me. “Do you think I 
should let him do it, or should I just do as other parents do and just buy him a car?” 

To which I answered. “It might relieve the pressure in the short term, but what have you taught 
him in the long term? Can you use this desire to own a car and inspire your son to learn 
something?” Suddenly the lights went on, and he hurried home. 

Two months later I ran into my friend again. “Does your son have his new car?” I asked. 

“No, he doesn’t. But I went and handed him $3,000 for the car. I told him to use my money 
instead of his college money.” “Well, that’s generous of you,” I said. 

“Not really. The money came with a hitch. I took your advice of using his strong desire to buy a 
car and use that energy so he could learn something.” 

“So what was the hitch?” I asked. 

“Well, first we broke out your game again, CASHFLOW. We played it and had a long discussion 
about the wise use of money. I then gave him a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, and a 
few books on the stock market.” 

“Then what?” I asked. “What was the catch?” 

“I told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car with it. He could use it to buy 
and sell stocks, find his own stockbroker, and once he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the 
money would be his for the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.” 

“And what are the results?” I asked. 

"Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost all he gained a few days later. Then, he really got 
interested. Today, I would say he is down $2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the 
books I bought him and he’s gone to the library to get more. He reads the Wall Street Journal 
voraciously, watching for indicators, and he watches CNBC instead of MTV. He’s got only 
$1,000 left, but his interest and learning are sky high. He knows that if he loses that money, he 
walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems 

uninterested in getting a car because he’s found a game that is more fun." 

“What happens if he loses all the money?” I asked. 

“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I’d rather have him lose everything now rather than 
wait till he’s our age to risk losing everything. And besides, that is the best $3,000 I’ve ever 
spent on his education. What he is learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained 
a new respect for the power of money. I think he’s stopped the burning of holes in his pockets.” 

As I said in the section “Pay Yourself First,” if a person cannot master the power of self- 
discipline, it is best not to try to get rich. For while the process of developing cash flow from an 


Page 100/114

asset column in theory is easy, it is the mental fortitude of directing money that is hard. Due to 
external temptations, it is much easier in today’s consumer world to simply blow it out the 
expense column. Because of weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of least 
resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle. 

I gave this numerical example of financial intelligence, in this case the ability to direct money to 
make more money. If we gave 100 people $10,000 at the start of the year, I gave my opinion 
that at the end of the year: 

80 would have nothing left. In fact, many would have created I greater debt by making a down 
payment on a new car, refrigerator, TV, VCR or a holiday. 16 would have increased that 
$10,000 by 5 percent to 10 percent. 4 would have increased it to $20,000 or into the millions. 

We go to school to learn a profession so we can work for money. It is my opinion that it is also 
important to learn how to have money work for you. 

I love my luxuries as much as anyone else. The difference is, some people buy their luxuries on 
credit. It’s the keep-up-with-the-Joneses trap. When I wanted to buy a Porsche, the easy road 
would have been to call my banker and get a loan. Instead of choosing to focus in the liability 
column, I chose to focus in the asset column. 

As a habit, I used my desire to consume to inspire and motivate my financial genius to invest. 

Too often today, we focus to borrowing money to get the things we want instead of focusing on 
creating money. One is easier in the short term, but harder in the long term. It’s a bad habit that 
we as individuals and as a nation have gotten into. Remember, the easy road often becomes 
hard, and the hard road often becomes easy. 

The earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters of money, the better. Money 
is a powerful force. Unfortunately, people use the power of money against them. If your 
financial intelligence is low, money will run all over you. It will be smarter than you. If money is 
smarter than you, you will work for it all your life. 

To be the master of money, you need to be smarter than it. Then money will do as it is told. It 
will obey you. Instead of being a slave to it, you will be the master of it. That is financial 
intelligence. 

9. THE NEED FOR HEROES: The power of myth. When I was a kid, I greatly admired Willie 
Mays, Hank Aaron, Yogi Berra. They were my heroes. As a kid playing Little League, I wanted 
to be just like them. I treasured their baseball cards. I wanted to know everything about them. I 
knew the stats, the RBI, the ERAs, their batting averages, how much they got paid, and how 
they came up 1 from the minors. I wanted to know everything because I wanted to be just like 
them. 

Every time, as a 9 or 10 year-old kid, when 1 stepped up to bat or played first base or catcher, I 
wasn’t me. I was Yogi or Hank. It’s one of the most powerful ways we learn that we often lose 
as adults. We lose our heroes. We lose our naivete. 

Today, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home. On the court they’re not little 
Johnny; they’re Michael Jordan, Sir Charles or Clyde. Copying or emulating heroes is true

power learning. And that is why when someone like O.J. Simpson falls from grace, there is such 
a huge outcry. 

There is more than just a courtroom trial. It is the loss of a hero. Someone people grew up with, 
looked up to, and wanted to be like. Suddenly we need to rid ourselves of that person. 

I have new heroes as I grow older. I have golf heroes such as Peter Jacobsen, Fred Couples and 
Tiger Woods. I copy their swings and do my best to read everything I can about them. I also 
have heroes such as Donald Trump, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, George Soros and Jim 
Rogers. In my older years, I know their stats just like I knew the ERAs and RBI of my baseball 
heroes. 1 follow what Warren Buffett invests in, and read anything I can about his point of view 
on the market. I read Peter Lynch’s book to understand how he chooses stocks. And 1 read 
about Donald Trump, trying to find out how he negotiates and puts deals together. 

Just as I was not me when I was up to bat, when I’m in the market or I’m negotiating a deal, I 
am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump. Or when analyzing a trend, I look at it as 
though Peter Lynch were doing it. By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw 
genius. 

But heroes do more than simply inspire us. Heroes make things look easy. It’s the making it 
look easy that convinces us to want to be just like them. “If they can do it, so can I.” 

When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard. Instead find heroes who 
make it look easy. 

10. TEACH AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE: The power of giving. Both of my dads were 
teachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson I have carried all my life, and that was the necessity of 
being charitable or giving. My educated dad gave a lot by the way of time and knowledge, but 
almost never gave away money. As I said, he usually said that he would give when he had some 
extra money. Of course, there was rarely any extra. 

My rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly in tithing. “If you want 
something, you first need to give,” he would always say. When he was short of money, he 
simply gave money to his church or to his favorite charity. 

If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel “short” or in “need” 
of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, 
a smile, love, friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but; it has 
always worked for me. 1 just trust that the principle of reciprocity it is true, and I give what I 
want. I want money, so I give money, and it comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help 
someone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want contacts and I help someone else 
get contacts, and like magic, contacts come to me. I heard a saying years ago that went, “God 
does not need to receive, but humans need to give.” 

My rich dad would often say, “Poor people are more greedy than rich people.” He would 
explain that if a person was rich, that person was providing something that other people 
wanted. In my life, over all these ; years, whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short 
of help, I simply went out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it first. And 
when I gave, it always came back.

It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on a cold freezing night, 
and he is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, “When you give me some heat, then I’ll put some 
wood in.” And when it comes to money, love, happiness, sales and contacts, all one needs to 
remember is first to give what you want and it will come back in droves. ? Often just the process 
of thinking of what I want, and how could I give what I want to someone else, breaks free a 
torrent of bounty. Whenever I feel that people aren’t smiling at me, I simply begin smiling and 
saying hello, and like magic, there are suddenly more smiling people around me. It is true that 
your world is only a mirror of you. 

So that’s why I say, “Teach and you shall receive.” I have found that the more I sincerely teach 
those who want to learn, the more I learn. If you want to learn about money, teach it to 
someone else. A torrent of new ideas and finer distinctions will come in. 

There are times when I have given and nothing has come back or what I have received is not 
what I wanted. But upon closer inspection and soul searching, I was often giving to receive in 
those instances, instead of giving to give. 

My dad taught teachers, and he became a master teacher. My rich dad always taught young 
people his way of doing business. In retrospect, it was their generosity with what they knew that 
made them smarter. There are powers in this world that are much smarter than we are. You 
can get there on your own, but it’s easier with the help of the powers that be. All you need to 
be is generous with what you have, and the powers will be generous with you.

CHAPTER TEN 


Still Want More? Here are Some To Do’s 

Many people may not be satisfied with my ten steps. They see them more as philosophies than 
actions. I think understanding the philosophy is just as important as the action. There are many 
people who want to do, instead of think, and then there are people who think but do not do. I 
would say that I am both. I love new ideas and I love action. 

So for those who want “to dos” on how to get started, I will share with you some of the things I 
do, in abbreviated form. 

Stop doing what you’re doing. In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what 
is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different 
result. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do. 

Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look for books on different 
and unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to 

books on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore that I found the 
book The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the book and read it. 

TAKE ACTION! The next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Step by step. I have also 
done that with finding real estate bargains in attorneys’ offices and in banks. Most people do not 
take action, or they let someone talk them out of whatever new formula they are studying. My 
neighbor told me why 16 percent would not work. I did not listen to him because he’s never 
done it. 

Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask them for tips, for 
little tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien certificates, I went to the county tax office and 
found the government employee who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in 
the tax liens. Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything she 
knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me everything. By the next 
day, I found two great properties with her help and have been accruing interest at 16 percent 
ever since. It took a day to read the book, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to 
acquire two great deals. 

Take classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and interesting classes. Many are 
for free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I 
am wealthy and free from needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who 
did not take those classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they’re still at the same 
job. 

Make lots of offers. When I want a piece of real estate, I look at many properties and generally 
write an offer. If you don’t know what the “right offer” is, neither do I. That is ’the job of the 
real estate agent. They make the offers. I do as little work as possible.

A friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses. So one Saturday she, her agent 
and I went and looked at six apartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to 
write offers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the agent nearly had 
heart attacks. They thought it would be rude, that 1 might offend the sellers, but I really don’t 
think the agent wanted to work that hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better 
deal. 

No offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the “right” deal at the right price. 
Well, you don’t know what the right price is until you have a second party who wants to deal. 
Most sellers ask too much. It is rare that a seller will actually ask a price that is less than 
something is worth. 

Moral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea what it feels like to 
be trying to sell something. I have had a piece of real estate that 1 wanted to sell for months. I 
would have welcomed anything. I would not care how low the price. They could have offered 
me ten pigs and I would have been happy. Not at the offer, but just because someone was 
interested. I would have countered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that’s how the game 
works. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun and only a game. Make 
offers. Someone might say “yes.” 

And I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with the words 
“subject to approval of business partner.” I never specify who the business partner is. Most 
people do not know my partner is my cat. If they accept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I 
call my home and speak to my cat. 1 make this absurd statement to illustrate how absurdly easy 
and simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and take them too seriously. 

Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right investors, or whatever is just 
like dating. You must go to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, 
counteroffers, negotiate, reject and accept. I know single people who sit at home and wait for 
the phone to ring, but unless you’re Cindy Crawford or Tom Cruise, I think you’d best go to the 
market, even if it’s only the supermarket. Search, offer, reject, negotiate and accept are all parts 
of the process of almost everything in life. 

Jog, walk or drive a certain area once a month for ten minutes. I have found some of my best 
real estate investments while jogging. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year. What I look 
for is change. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two elements: a bargain and 
change. There are lots of bargains, but it’s change that turns a bargain into a profitable 
opportunity. So when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in. It is the repetition that 
causes me to notice slight differences. I notice real estate signs that are up for a long time. That 
means the seller might be more agreeable to deal. I watch for moving trucks, going in or out. I 
stop and talk to the drivers. I talk to the postal carriers. It’s amazing how much information they 
acquire about an area. 

I find a bad area, especially an area that the news has scared everyone away from. I drive it for 
sometimes a year waiting for signs of something changing for the better. I talk to retailers, 
especially new ones, and find out why they’re moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month, 
and I do it while doing something else, like exercising, or going 


Page 105/114

to and from the store. 

As for stocks, I like Peter Lynch’s book Beating the Street for his formula for selecting stocks 
that grow in value. I have found that the principles of finding value are the same regardless if it’s 
real estate, stocks, mutual funds, new companies, a new pet, a new home, a new spouse, or a 
bargain on laundry detergent. The process is always the same. You need to know what you’re 
looking for and then go look for it! 

Why consumers will always be poor. When the supermarket has a sale on, say, toilet paper, the 
consumer runs in and stocks up. When the stock market has a sale, most often called a crash or 
correction, the consumer runs away from it. When the supermarket raises its prices, the 
consumer shops elsewhere. When the stock market raises its prices, the consumer starts buying. 

Look in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for $100,000. I bought the 
identical condo next door to his for $50,000. He told me he’s waiting for the price to go up. I 
told him that his profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. He shopped with a real estate 
broker who owns no property of her own. I shopped at the foreclosure department of a bank. I 
paid $500 for a class on how to do this. My neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate 
investment class was too expensive. He said he could not afford it, and he couldn’t afford the 
time. So he waits for the price to go up. 

I look for people who want to buy first, then I look for someone who wants to sell. A friend was 
looking for a certain piece of land. He had the money and did not have the time. 1 found a large 
piece of land larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied it up with an option, called my 
friend and he wanted a piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the land. I kept 
the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the story: Buy the pie and cut it in pieces. Most 
people look for what they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only a piece of the pie, 
so they end up paying more for less. 

Small thinkers don’t get the big breaks. If you want to get richer, think bigger first. 

Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply because most business people love big spenders. 
So even if you're small, you can always think big. When my company was in the market for 
computers, I called several friends and asked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went 
to different dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted to buy so many. I have done 
the same with stocks. Small people remain small because they think small; act alone, or don’t 
act all. 

Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock exchange started out as small 
companies. Colonel Sanders did not get rich until after he lost everything in his 60s. Bill Gates 
was one of the richest men in the world before he was 30. 

Action always beats inaction. 

These are just a few of the things I have done and continue to do to recognize opportunities. 
The important words being “done” and “do”. As repeated many times throughout the book, you 
must take action before you can receive the financial rewards. Act now!

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


How To Pay for a Child’s College Education for $7000 

As the book draws to a close and approaches publication, I would like to share a final thought 
with you. The main reason I wrote this book was to share insights into how increased financial 
intelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. Without financial training, we 
all too often use the standard formulas to get through life, such as to work hard, save, borrow 
and pay excessive taxes. Today we need better information. 

I use the following story as a final example of a financial problem that confronts many young 
families today. How do you afford a good education for your children and provide for your own 
retirement? It is an example of using financial intelligence instead of hard work to achieve the 
same goal. 

A friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to save money for his four 
children’s college education. He was putting $300 away in a mutual fund each month and had 
so far accumulated about $12,000. He estimated he needed $400,000 to get four children 
through college. He had 12 years to save for it, since his oldest child was then 6 years of age. 

The year was 1991, and the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People were giving 
houses away. I suggested to my classmate that he buy a house with some of the money in his 
mutual fund. The idea intrigued him and we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern 
was that he did not have the credit with the bank to buy another house, since he was so over- 
extended. I assured him that there were other ways to finance a property other than through 
the bank. 

We looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all the criteria we were looking for. 
There were a lot to choose from, so the shopping was kind of fun. Finally, we found a 3 
bedroom 2 bath home in a prime neighborhood. The owner had been downsized and needed to 
sell that day because he and his family were moving to California where another job waited. 

He wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took it immediately. The home had on 
it what is called a non-qualifying loan, which means even a bum without a job could buy it 
without a banker’s approval. The owner owed $72,000 so all my friend had to come up with 
was $7,000, the difference in price between what was owed and what it sold for. As soon as the 
owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all expenses were paid, including the 
mortgage, he put about $125 in his pocket each month. 

His plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage get paid down faster, by 
applying the extra $125 to the principle each month. We figured that in 12 years, a large 
portion of the mortgage would be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by 
the time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it had appreciated in value. 

In 1994, the real estate market suddenly changed in Phoenix and he was offered $156,000 for 
the same house by the tenant who lived in it and loved it. Again, he asked me what I thought, 
and I naturally said sell, on a 1031 tax-deferred exchange. 

Suddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another friend in Austin, Texas who 
then moved this tax deferred money into a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began 
receiving checks for a little less than a $1,000 a month in income which he then poured back 


Page 107/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


into the college mutual fund that was now building much faster. In 1996, the mini-warehouse 
sold and he received a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale which was again 
rolled into a new project that would now throw off over $3,000 a month in income, again, 
going into the college mutual fund. He is now very confident that his goal of $400,000 will be 
met easily, and it only took $7,000 to start and a little financial intelligence. His children will be 
able to afford the education that they want and he will then use the underlying asset, wrapped in 
his C Corporation, to pay for his retirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy he 
will be able to retire early. 

Thank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some insights into utilizing the power of 
money to work for you. Today, we need greater financial intelligence to simply survive. The 
idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. It 
does not mean that they’re not intelligent. They have simply not learned the science of making 
money. 

Money is only an idea. If you want more money simply change your thinking. Every self-made 
person started small with an idea, then turned it into something big. The same applies with 
investing. It takes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet so many 
people who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to mass a lot of money to get into a 
big deal, but to me that is foolish. Too often 1 have seen unsophisticated investors put their large 
nest egg into one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers but they 
were not good investors. 

Education and wisdom about money are important. Start early. Buy a book. Go to a seminar. 
Practice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash into a $1 million dollar asset producing $5,000 a 
month cash flow in less than six years. But I started learning as a kid. 1 encourage you to learn 
because it’s not that hard. In fact, it’s kind of easy once you get the hang of it. 

I think I have made my message clear. It’s what is in your head that determines what is in your 
hands. Money is only an idea. There is a great book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not 
Work Hard and Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you and your life will be easier 
and happier. Today, don’t play it safe, play it smart. 

Take Action! 

Many of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you 
please with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power 
to determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly, you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you 
join the middle class. Invest it in your mind and learn how to acquire assets and you will be 
choosing wealth as your goal and your future. The choice is yours and only yours. Every day 
with every dollar, you decide to be rich, poor or middle class. 

Choose to share this knowledge with your children, and you choose to prepare them for the 
world that awaits. No one else will. 

You and your children’s future will be determined by choices you make today, not tomorrow. 

We wish you great wealth and much happiness with this fabulous gift called life.

Few students of management and organization -- and people-- have thought as long and hard about 
first principles as Stephen Covey. In The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, he offers us an

your life.

Paradigms and Principles 

INSIDE-OUT 


There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living 

- David Starr Jordan 

* * * 

In more than 25 years of working with people in business, university, and marriage and family 
settings, I have come in contact with many individuals who have achieved an incredible degree of 
outward success, but have found themselves struggling with an inner hunger, a deep need for personal 
congruency and effectiveness and for healthy, growing relationships with other people. 

I suspect some of the problems they have shared with me may be familiar to you. 

I've set and met my career goals and I'm having tremendous professional success. But it's cost me 
my personal and family life. I don't know my wife and children anymore. I'm not even sure I know 
myself and what's really important to me. I've had to ask myself-- is it worth it? 

I've started a new diet -- for the fifth time this year. I know I'm overweight, and I really want to 
change. I read all the new information, I set goals, I get myself all psyched up with a positive mental 
attitude and tel I myself I can do it. But I don't. After a few weeks, I fizzle. I just can't seem to keep a 
promise I make to myself. 

I've taken course after course on effective management training. I expect a lot out of my employees 
and I work hard to be friendly toward them and to treat them right. But I don't feel any loyalty from 
them. I think if I were home sick for a day, they'd spend most of their time gabbing at the water 
fountain. Why can't I train them to be independent and responsible-- or find employees who can be? 

My teenage son is rebellious and on drugs. No matter what I try, he won't listen to me. What can 
I do? 

There's so much to do. And there's never enough time. I feel pressured and hassled alI day, every 
day, seven daysa week. I've attended time management seminars and I'vetried half adozen different 
planning systems. They've hel ped some, but I still don't feel I'm living the happy, productive, peaceful 
life I want to live. 

I wantto teach my children the valueof work. But to get them to do anything, I have to supervise 
every move; and put up with complaining every step of the way. It's so much easier to do it myself. 
Why can't children do their work cheerfully and without being reminded? 

I'm busy -- really busy. But sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing will make a difference in the 
long run. I'd really like to think there was meaning in my life, that somehow things were different 
because I was here. 

I see my friends or relatives achieve some degree of success or receive some recognition, and I smile 
and congratulate them enthusiastically. Butinside, I'm eating my heart out. Why dol feel thisway? 

I haveaforceful personality. I know, in almost any interaction, I can control theoutcome. Most of 
the time, I can even do it by influencing others to come up with the solution I want. I think through 
each situation and I really feel the ideas I come up with are usually the best for everyone. But I feel 
uneasy. I always wonder what other people really think of meand my ideas. 

My marriage has gone flat. We don't fight or anything; we just don't love each other anymore. 
We've goneto counseling; we've tried a number of things, but wejust can't seem to rekindle the feeling 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


we used to have. 

These are deep problems, painful problems-- problems that quick fix approaches can't solve. 

A few years ago, my wife Sandra and I were struggling with this kind of concern. One of our sons 
was having a very difficult time in school. He was doing poorly academically; he didn't even know 
how to follow the instructions on the tests, let alonedo well in them. Socially hewas immature, often 
embarrassing those closest to him. Athletically, he was small, skinny, and uncoordinated -- swinging 
his baseball bat, for example, almost before the ball was even pitched. Others would laugh at him. 

Sandra and I were consumed with a desire to help him. Wefelt that if "success" were important in 
any area of life, it was supremely important in our role as parents. So we worked on our attitudes and 
behavior toward him and we tried to work on his. We attempted to psyche him up using positive 
mental attitude techniques. "Come on, son! You can do it! We know you can. Put your hands a little 
higher on the bat and keep your eye on the ball. Don't swing till it gets close to you." And if he did a 
little better, we would go to great lengths to reinforce him. "That's good, son, keep itup." 

When others laughed, we reprimanded them. "Leave him alone. Get off his back. He's just 
learning." And our son would cry and insist that he'd never beany good and that hedidn't like baseball 
anyway. 

Nothing we did seemed to help, and we were really worried. We could see the effect this was 
having on his self-esteem. We tried to be encouraging and helpful and positive, but after repeated 
failure, wefinally drew back and tried to look at the situation on a different level. 

At this time in my professional role I was involved in leadership development work with various 
clients throughout the country. In that capacity I was preparing bimonthly programs on the subject of 
communication and perception for IBM's Executive Development Program participants. 

As I researched and prepared these presentations, I became particularly interested in how 
perceptions are formed, how they behave. This led me to a study of expectancy theory and 
self-fulfilling prophecies or the "Pygmalion effect," and to a realization of how deeply imbedded our 
perceptions are. It taught me that we must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as 
at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world. 

As Sandra and I talked about the concepts I was teaching at IBM and about our own situation, we 
began to realize that what we were doing to help our son was not in harmony with the way we really 
saw him. When we honestly examined our deepest feelings, we realized that our perception was that 
hewas basically inadequate, somehow "behind." No matter how much we worked on our attitude and 
behavior, our efforts were ineffective because, despite our actions and our words, what we really 
communicated to him was, "You aren't capable. You have to be protected." 

We began to realize that if we wanted to change the situation, we first had to change ourselves. 
And to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions. 

The Personality and Character Ethics 

At the same time, in addition to my research on perception, I was also deeply immersed in an 
in-depth study of the success literature published in the United States since 1776. I was reading or 
scanning literally hundreds of books, articles, and essays in fields such as self-improvement, popular 
psychology, and self-help. At my fingertips was the sum and substance of what a free and democratic 
people considered to be the keys to successful living. 

As my study took me back through 200 years of writing about success, I noticed a startling pattern 
emerging in the content of the literature. Because of our own pain, and because of similar pain I had 
seen in the lives and relationships of many people I had worked with through the years, I began to feel 










THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


more and more that much of the success literature of the past 50 years was superficial. It was filled 
with social image consciousness, techniques and quick fixes -- with social band-aids and aspirin that 
addressed acute problems and sometimes even appeared to solve them temporarily -- but left the 
underlying chronic problems untouched to fester and resurface time and again. 

In stark contrast, almost all the literature in the first 150 years or so focused on what could be called 
the character ethic as the foundation of success -- things like integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, 
courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule. Benjamin Franklin's 
autobiography is representative of that literature. It is, basically, the story of one man's effort to 
integrate certain principles and habits deep within hisnature. 

The character ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only 
experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their 
basic character. 

But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the character ethic to what we 
might call the personality ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of 
attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. This 
personality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public relations techniques, and the 
other was positive mental attitude (PMA). Some of this philosophy was expressed in inspiring and 
sometimes valid maxims such as "Your attitude determines your altitude," "Smiling wins more friends 
than frowning," and "Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe it can achieve. 

Other parts of the personality approach were clearly manipulative, even deceptive, encouraging 
people to use techniques to get other people to I ike them, or to fake interest in the hobbies of others to 
get out of them what they wanted, or to use the "power look," or to inti mi date their way through life. 

Some of this literature acknowledged character as an ingredient of success, but tended to 
compartmentalize it rather than recognize it as foundational and catalytic. Reference to the character 
ethic became mostly lip service; the basic thrust was quick-fix influence techniques, power strategies, 
communication skills, and positive attitudes. 

This personality ethic, I began to realize, was the subconscious source of the solutions Sandra and I 
were attempting to use with our son. As I thought more deeply about the difference between the 
personality and character ethics, I realized that Sandra and I had been getting social mileage out of our 
children's good behavior, and, in our eyes, this son simply didn't measure up. Our image of ourselves, 
and our role as good, caring parents was even deeper than our image of our son and perhaps influenced 
it. There was a lot more wrapped up in the way we were seeing and handling the problem than our 
concern for our son's welfare. 

As Sandra and I talked, we became painfully aware of the powerful influence of our character and 
motives and of our perception of him. We knew that social comparison motives were out of harmony 
with our deeper values and could lead to conditional love and eventually to our son's lessened sense of 
self-worth. So we determined to focus our efforts on us -- not on our techniques, but on our deepest 
motives and our perception of him. Instead of trying to change him, we tried to stand apart -- to 
separate us from him -- and to sense his identity, individuality, separateness, and worth. 

Through deep thought and the exercise of faith and prayer, we began to see our son in terms of his 
own uniqueness. We saw within him layers and layers of potential that would be realized at his own 
pace and speed. We decided to relax and get out of his way and let his own personality emerge. We 
saw our natural role as being to affirm, enjoy, and value him. We also conscientiously worked on our 
motives and cultivated internal sources of security so that our own feelings of worth were not 
dependent on our children's "acceptable" behavior. 

As we loosened up our old perception of our son and developed value-based motives, new feelings 
began to emerge. We found ourselves enjoying him instead of comparing or judging him. We 
stopped trying to clone him in our own image or measure him against social expectations. We 




THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Bmucjt to you tyHyHsnt 


stopped trying to kindly, positively manipulate him into an acceptable social mold. Because we saw 
him as fundamentally adequate and able to cope with life, we stopped protecting him against the 
ridicule of others. 

He had been nurtured on this protection, so he went through some withdrawal pains, which he 
expressed and which we accepted, but did not necessarily respond to. "We don't need to protect you," 
was the unspoken message. 'You'refundamentally okay." 

As the weeks and months passed, he began to feel a quiet confidence and affirmed himself. He 
began to blossom, at his own pace and speed. He became outstanding as measured by standard social 
criteria -- academically, socially and athletically -- at a rapid clip, far beyond the so-called natural 
developmental process. As the years passed, he was elected to several student body leadership 
positions, developed into an all-state athlete and started bringing home straight A report cards. He 
developed an engaging and guileless personality that has enabled him to relate in nonthreatening ways 
to all kinds of people. 

Sandra and I believe that our son's "socially impressive" accomplishments were more a 
serendipitous expression of the feelings he had about himself than merely a response to social reward. 
This was an amazing experience for Sandra and me, and a very instructional one in dealing with our 
other children and in other roles as well. It brought to our awareness on a very personal level the vital 
difference between the personality ethic and the character ethic of success. The Psalmist expressed our 
conviction well: "Search your own heart with all diligencefor out of it flow the issues of life." 

Primary and Secondary Greatness 

My experience with my son, my study of perception and my reading of the success literature 
coalesced to create one of those "Aha!" experiences in life when suddenly things click into place. I was 
suddenly able to seethe powerful impact of the personality ethic and to clearly understand those subtle, 
often consciously unidentified discrepancies between what I knew to be true - somethings I had been 
taught many years ago as a child and things that were deep in my own inner sense of value - and the 
quick fix philosophies that surrounded me every day. I understood at a deeper level why, as I had 
worked through the years with peoplefrom all walks of life, I had found that the things I was teaching 
and knew to be effective were often at variance with these popular voices. 

I am not suggesting that elements of the personality ethic -- personality growth, communication skill 
training, and education in the field of influence strategies and positive thinking - are not beneficial, in 
fact sometimes essential for success. I believe they are. But these are secondary, not primary traits. 
Perhaps, in utilizing our human capacity to build on the foundation of generations before us, we have 
inadvertently become so focused on our own building that we have forgotten the foundation that holds 
it up; or in reaping for so long where we have not sown, perhaps we have forgotten the need to sow. 

If I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other peopleto do what I want, to 
work better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other - while my character is fundamentally 
flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity - then, in the long run, I cannot be successful. My 
duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do - even using so-called good human relations 
techniques - will be perceived as manipulative. It simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric 
is or even how good the intentions are; if there is littleor no trust, there is no foundation for permanent 
success. Only basic goodness gives life to technique. 

To focus on technique is like cramming your way through school. You sometimes get by, perhaps 
even get good grades, but if you don't pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery 
of the subjects you study or develop an educated mind. 

Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm - to forget to plant in the 
spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest? The farm is a natural system. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

The price must be paid and the process foil owed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut. 

This principle is also true, ultimately, in human behavior, in human relationships. They, too, are 
natural systems based on theTheLaw of the H arvest. In the short run, in an artificial social system such 
as school, you may be able to get by if you learn how to manipulate the man-made rules, to "play the 
game." In most one-shot or short-lived human interactions, you can use the personality ethic to get by 
and to make favorable impressions through charm and skill and pretending to be interested in other 
people's hobbies. You can pick up quick, easy techniques that may work in short-term situations. 
But secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term relationships. Eventually, if there 
isn't deep integrity and fundamental character strength, the challenges of life will cause true motives to 
surface and human relationship failure will replace short-term success. 

Many people with secondary greatness -- that is, social recognition for their talents -- lack primary 
greatness or goodness i n thei r character. Sooner or later, you'll see this in every long-term relationship 
they have, whether it is with a business associate, a spouse, a friend, or a teenage child going through 
an identity crisis. It is character that communicates most eloquently. As Emerson once put it, "What 
you are shouts so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear what you say." 

There are, of course, situations where people have character strength but they lack communication 
skills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well. But the effects are still 
secondary. 

In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do. 
We all know it. There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character. Whether 
they're eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations techniques or not, we trust them, and 
we work successful ly with them. 

In the words of William George Jordan, "Into the hands of every individual is given a marvelous 
power for good or evil -- the silent unconscious, unseen influence of his life. This is simply the 
constant radiation of what man really is, not what he pretends to be." 

The Power of a Paradigm 

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People embody many of the fundamental principles of human 
effectiveness. These habits are basic; they are primary. They represent the internalization of correct 
principles upon which enduring happiness and success are based. 

But before we can really understand these Seven Habits TM, we need to understand our own 
"paradigms" and how to make a "A Paradigm Shift TM." 

Both the The Character Ethic The Personality Ethic are examples of social paradigms. The word 
paradigm comes from the Greek. It was originally a scientific term, and is more commonly used today 
to mean a model, theory, perception, assumption, or frame of reference. I n the more general sense, it's 
the way we "see" the world -- not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, 
understanding, and interpreting. 

For our purposes, a simple way to understand paradigms is to see them as maps. Weall know that 
"the map is not the territory." A map is simply an explanation of certain aspects of the territory. That's 
exactly what a paradigm is. It is a theory, an explanation, or model of something else. 

Suppose you wanted to arrive at a specific location in central Chicago. A street map of the city 
would be a great help to you in reaching your destination. But suppose you were given the wrong 
map. Through a printing error, the map labeled "Chicago" was actually a map of Detroit. Can you 
imagine the frustration, the ineffectiveness of trying to reach your destination? 

You might work on your behavior -- you could try harder, be more diligent, double your speed. 
But your efforts would only succeed in getting you tothewrong place faster. 














THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


You might work on your attitude-- you could think more positively. You still wouldn't get to the 
right place, but perhaps you wouldn't care. Your attitude would be so positive, you'd be happy 
wherever you were. 

The point is, you'd still be lost. The fundamental problem has nothing to do with your behavior or 
your attitude. It has everything to do with having a wrong map. 

If you have the right map of Chicago, then diligence becomes important, and when you encounter 
frustrating obstacles along the way, then attitude can make a real difference. But the first and most 
important requirement is the accuracy of the map. 

Each of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: maps 
of the way things are, or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values. We interpret 
everything we experience through these mental maps. We seldom question their accuracy; we're 
usually even unaware that we have them. We simply assume that the way we see things is the way 
they really are or the way they should be. 

And our attitudes and behaviors grow out of those assumptions. The way we see things is the 
source of the way wethink and theway weact. 

Before going any further, I invite you to have an intellectual and emotional experience. Take a few 
seconds and just look at the picture on the foil owing page 

Now look at the picture below and carefully describe what you see 

Do you seea woman? How old would you say she is? What does she look like? What is she wearing? 
In what kind of roles do you see her? 

You probably would describe the woman in the second picture to be about 25 years old -- very 
lovely, rather fashionable with a petite nose and demure presence. If you were a single man you 
might I ike to take her out. If you were in retailing, you might hire her as a fashion model. 

But what if I were to tell you that you're wrong? What if I said this picture is of a woman in her 60s 
or 70s who looks sad, has a huge nose, and certainly is no model. She's someone you probably would 
hel p cross the street. 

Who's right? Look at the picture again. Can you see the old woman? If you can't, keep trying. 
Can you see her big hook nose? H er shawl? 

If you and I were talking face to face, we could discuss the picture. You could describe what you 
see to me, and I could talk to you about what I see. We could continue to communicate until you 
clearly showed me what you see in the picture and I clearly showed you what I see. 

Because we can't do that, turn to page 45 and study the picture there and then look at this picture 
again. Can you seethe old woman now? It's i important that you see her before you continue reading. 

I first encountered this exercise many years ago at the Harvard Business School. The instructor was 
using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two peoplecan see the same thing, disagree, and yet 
both be right. It's not logical; it's psychological. 

He brought into the room a stack of large cards, half of which had the image of the young woman 
you saw on page 25, and the other half of which had the old woman on page 45. 

He passed them out to the class, the picture of the young woman to one side of the room and the 
picture of the old woman to the other. H e asked us to look at the cards, concentrate on them for about 
10 seconds and then pass them back in. He then projected upon the screen the picture you saw on 
page 26 combining both images and asked the class to describe what they saw. Almost every person 
in that class who had first seen the young woman's image on a card saw the young woman in the 
picture. And almost every person in that class who had first seen the old woman's image on a card 
saw an old woman in the picture. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

The professor then asked one student to explain what he saw to a student on the opposite side of the 
room. Asthey talked back and forth, communication problems flared up. 

"What do you mean, 'old lady'? She couldn't be more than 20 or 22 years old! 

"Oh,comeon. You have to be joking. She's 70--could be pushing 80!" 

"What's the matter with you? A re you blind? This lady is young, good looking. I'd I ike to take 
her out. She's lovely." 

"Lovely? She's an old hag. 

The arguments went back and forth, each person sure of, and adamant in, his or her position. All 
of this occurred in spite of one exceedingly important advantage the students had -- most of them knew 
early in the demonstration that another point of view did, in fact, exist -- something many of us would 
never admit. Nevertheless, at first, only a few students really tried to see this picture from another 
frame of reference. 

After a period of futile communication, one student went up to the screen and pointed to a line on 
the drawing. "There is the young woman's necklace." The other one said, "No, that is the old woman's 
mouth." Gradually, they began to calmly discuss specific points of difference, and finally one student, 
and then another, experienced sudden recognition when the images of both came into focus. Through 
continued calm, respectful, and specific communication, each of us in the room was finally able to see 
the other point of view. But when we looked away and then back, most of us would immediately see 
the image we had been conditioned to see in the 10-second period of time. 

I frequently use this perception demonstration in working with people and organizations because it 
yields so many deep insights into both personal and interpersonal effectiveness. It shows, first of all, 
how powerfully conditioning affects our perceptions, our paradigms. If 10 seconds can have that kind 
of impact on the way we see things, what about the conditioning of a lifetime? The influences in our 
lives -- family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms such 
as the personality ethic -- all have made their silent unconscious impact on us and help shape our frame 
of reference, our paradigms, our maps. 

It also shows that these paradigms are the source of our attitudes and behaviors. We cannot act 
with integrity outside of them. We simply cannot maintain wholeness if we talk and walk differently 
than we see. If you were among the 90 percent who typically see the young woman in the composite 
picture when conditioned to do so, you undoubtedly found it difficult to think in terms of having to 
help her cross the street. Both your attitude about her and your behavior toward her had to be 
congruent with the way you saw her. 

This brings into focus one of the basic flaws of the personality ethic. To try to change outward 
attitudes and behaviors does very Iittle good in the long run if wefail to examine the basic paradigms 
from which those attitudes and behaviors flow. 

This perception demonstration also shows how powerfully our paradigms affect the way we interact 
with other people. As clearly and objectively as wethink we see things, we begin to realize that others 
see them differently from their own apparently equally clear and objective point of view. "Where we 
stand depends on where we sit." 

Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. 
We seethe world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our 
mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. 
When other people disagree with us, we immediately think something is wrong with them. But, as the 
demonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the 
unique lens of experience. 

This does not mean that there are no facts. In the demonstration, two individuals who initially 
have been influenced by different conditioning pictures look at the third picture together. They are 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


now both looking at the same identical facts -- black lines and white spaces -- and they would both 
acknowledge these as facts. But each person's interpretation of these facts represents prior experiences, 
and the facts have no meaning whatsoever apart from the interpretation. 

The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we 
have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, 
examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby 
getting a larger picture and afar more objective view. 

The Power of a Paradigm Shift 

Perhaps the most important insight to be gained from the perception demonstration is in the area of 
paradigm shifting, what we might call the "Aha!" experience when someone finally "sees" the composite 
picture in another way. The more bound a person is by the initial perception, the more powerful the 
"Aha!" experienceis. It's as though a light were suddenly turned on inside. 

The term Paradigm Shift was introduced by Thomas Kuhn in his highly influential landmark book, 
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn shows how almost every significant breakthrough in the 
field of scientific endeavor isfirsta break with tradition, with old ways of thinking, with old paradigms. 

For Ptolemy, the great Egyptian astronomer, the earth was the center of the universe. But 
Copernicus created a Paradigm Shift, and a great deal of resistance and persecution as well, by placing 
the sun at the center. Suddenly, everything took on a different interpretation. 

The Newtonian model of physics was a clockwork paradigm and is still the basis of modern 
engineering. But it was partial, incomplete. The scientific world was revolutionized by the 
Einsteinian paradigm, the relativity paradigm, which had much higher predictive and explanatory 
value. 

Until the germ theory was developed, a high percentage of women and children died during 
childbirth, and one could understand why. In military skirmishes, more men were dying from small 
wounds and diseases than from the major traumas on the front lines. But as soon as the germ theory 
was developed, a whole new paradigm, a better, improved way of understanding what was happening 
made dramatic, significant medical improvement possible. 

The United States today is the fruit of a Paradigm Shift. The traditional concept of government for 
centuries had been a monarchy, the divine right of kings. Then a different paradigm was developed -- 
government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And a constitutional democracy was 
born, unleashing tremendous human energy and ingenuity, and creating a standard of living, of 
freedom and liberty, of influence and hopeunequaled in the history of the world. 

Not all Paradigm Shifts are in positive directions. As we have observed, the shift from the 
character ethic to the personality ethic has drawn us away from the very roots that nourish true success 
and happiness. 

But whether they shift us in positive or negative directions, whether they are instantaneous or 
developmental, Paradigm Shifts move us from one way of seeing the world to another. And those 
shifts create powerful change. Our paradigms, correct or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and 
behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others. 

I remember a mini-Paradigm Shift I experienced one Sunday morning on a subway in New York. 
People were sitting quietly -- some reading newspapers, some lost in thought, some resting with their 
eyes cl osed. 11 was a cal m, peacefu I scene. 

Then suddenly, a man and his children entered the subway car. The children were so loud and 
rambu ncti ous that i nstantl y the w hoi e cl i mate changed. 

The man sat down next to me and closed his eyes, apparently oblivious to the situation. The 
children were yelling back and forth, throwing things, even grabbing people's papers. It was very 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


disturbing. And yet, the man sitting next to medid nothing. 

It was difficult not to feel irritated. I could not believe that he could be so insensitive to let his 
children run wild like that and do nothing about it, taking no responsibility at all. It was easy to see 
that everyone else on the subway felt irritated, too. So finally, with what I felt was unusual patience 
and restraint, I turned to him and said, "Sir, your children are really disturbing a lot of people. I 
wonder if you couldn't control them a little more?" 

The man lifted his gaze as if to come to a consciousness of the situation for the first time and said 
softly, "Oh, you're right. I guess I should do something about it. We just came from the hospital 
where their mother died about an hour ago. I don't know what to think, and I guess they don't know 
how to handle it either." 

Can you imagine what I felt at that moment? My paradigm shifted. Suddenly I saw things 
differently, I felt differently, I behaved differently. My irritation vanished. I didn't have to worry 
about controlling my attitude or my behavior; my heart was filled with the man's pain. Feelings of 
sympathy and compassion flowed freely. 'Your wife just died? Oh, I'm so sorry. Can you tell me 
about it? What can I do to help?" Everything changed in an instant. 

Many people experience a similar fundamental shift in thinking when they face a life-threatening 
crisis and suddenly see their priorities in a different light, or when they suddenly step into a new role, 
such as that of husband or wife, parent or grandparent, manager or leader. 

We could spend weeks, months, even years laboring with the personality ethic trying to change our 
attitudes and behaviors and not even begin to approach the phenomenon of change that occurs 
spontaneously when we see things differently. 

It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps 
appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum 
change, we need to work on our basic paradigms. 

In the words of Thoreau, "For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at 
the root." We can only achieve quantum improvements in our lives as we quit hacking at the leaves of 
attitude and behavior and get to work on the root, the paradigms from which our attitudes and 
behaviors flow. 

Seeing and Being 

Of course, not all Paradigm Shifts are instantaneous. Unlike my instant insight on the subway, the 
paradigm-shifting experience Sandra and I had with our son was a slow, difficult, and deliberate 
process. The approach we had first taken with him was the outgrowth of years of conditioning and 
experience in the personality ethic. It was the result of deeper paradigms we held about our own 
success as parents as well as the measure of success of our children. And it was not until we changed 
those basic paradigms, quantum change in ourselves and in the situation. 

In order to see our son differently, Sandra and I had to be differently. Our new paradigm was 
created as we invested in the growth and development of our own character. 

Our Paradigms are the way we "see" the world or circumstances -- not in terms of our visual sense of 
sight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding, and interpreting. Paradigms are inseparable from 
character. Being is seeing in the human dimension. And what we see is highly interrelated to what 
we are. We can't go very far to change our seeing without simultaneously changing our being, and 
vice versa. 

Even in my apparently instantaneous paradigm-shifting experience that morning on the subway, 
my change of vision was a result of -- and limited by-- my basic character. 

I'm sure there are people who, even suddenly understanding the true situation, would have felt no 
more than a twinge of regret or vague guilt as they continued to sit in embarrassed silence beside the 






THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


grieving, confused man. On the other hand, I am equally certain there are people who would have 
been far more sensitive in the first place, who may have recognized that a deeper problem existed and 
reached out to understand and help before I did. 

Paradigms are powerful because they create the lens through which we see the world. The power 
of a Paradigm Shift is the essential power of quantum change, whether that shift is an instantaneous or 
a slow and deli berate process. 

The Principle-Centered Paradigm 

The character ethic is based on the fundamental idea that there are principles that govern human 
effectiveness -- natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as unchanging and 
unarguably "there" as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension. 

An idea of the reality -- and the impact -- of these principles can be captured in another 
paradigm-shifting experience as told by Frank Kock in Proceedings, the magazine of the Naval 
Institute. 

Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather 
for several days. I was serving on the lead battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell. 
The visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all 
activities. 

Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, "Light, bearing on the starboard 
bow." 

"Is it steady or moving astern?" the captain called out. 

Lookout replied, "Steady, captain," which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that 
ship. 

The captain then called to the signal man, "Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you 
change course 20 degrees." 

Back came a signal, "Advisablefor you to change course 20 degrees." 

The captain said, "Send, I'm a captain, change course 20 degrees." 

"I'm a seaman second class," came the reply. "You had better change course 20 degrees." 

By that time, the captain was furious. He spat out, "Send, I'm a battleship. Change course 20 
degrees." 

Back came the flashing light, "I'm a lighthouse." 

We changed course 

The A Paradigm Shift is the "a-ha" experience associated with finally perceiving or understanding 
some aspect of the world (or a circumstance) in a different way. Paradigm Shift experienced by the 
captain -- and by us as we read this account-- puts the situation in a totally different light. We can see 
a reality that is superseded by his limited perceptions -- a reality that is as critical for us to understand 
in our daily lives as it was for the captain in the fog. 

Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken. AsCecil B. deMille 
observed of the principles contained in his monumental movie, The Ten Commandments, "It is 
impossiblefor us to break thelaw. Wecan only break ourselves against the law." 

While individuals may look at their own lives and interactions in terms of paradigms or maps 
emerging out of their experience and conditioning, these maps are not the territory. They are a 
"subjective reality," only an attempt to describe the territory. 

The "objective reality," or the territory itself, is composed of "lighthouse" principles that govern 
human growth and happiness -- natural laws that are woven into the fabric of every civilized society 
throughout history and comprise the roots of every family and institution that has endured and 
prospered. The degree to which our mental maps accurately describe the territory does not alter its 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


existence. 

The reality of such principles or natural laws becomes obvious to anyone who thinks deeply and 
examines the cycles of social history. These principles surface time and time again, and the degree to 
which people in society recognize and live in harmony with them moves them toward either survival 
and stability or disintegration and destruction. 

The principles I am referring to are not esoteric, mysterious, or "religious" ideas. There is not one 
principle taught in this book that is unique to any specific faith or religion, including my own. These 
principles are a part of every major enduring religion, as well as enduring social philosophies and 
ethical systems. They are self-evident and can easily be validated by any individual. It's almost as if 
these principles or natural laws are part of the human condition, part of the human consciousness, part 
of the human conscience. They seem to exist in all human beings, regardless of social conditioning and 
loyalty to them, even though they might be submerged or numbed by conditions or disloyalty. 

I am referring, for example, to the principle of fairness, out of which our whole concept of equity 
and justice is developed. Little children seem to have an innate sense of the idea of fairness even apart 
from opposite conditioning experiences. There are vast differences in how fairness is defined and 
achieved, but there is almost universal awareness of the idea. 

Other examples would include integrity and honesty. They create the foundation of trust which is 
essential to cooperation and long-term personal and interpersonal growth. 

Another principle is human dignity. The basic concept in the United States Declaration of 
Independence bespeaks this value or principle. "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men 
arecreated equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among thesearelife, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." 

Another principle is service, or the idea of making a contribution. Another is quality or excellence. 

There is the principle of potential, the idea that we are embryonic and can grow and develop and 
release more and more potential, develop more and more talents. Highly related to potential is the 
principle of growth -- the process of releasing potential and developing talents, with the accompanying 
need for principles such as patience, nurturanee, and encouragement. 

Principles are not practices. A practice is a specific activity or action. A practice that works in one 
circumstance will not necessarily work in another, as parents who have tried to raise a second child 
exactly likethey did thefirst onecan readily attest. 

While practices are situational ly specific, principles are deep, fundamental truths that have universal 
application. They apply to individuals, to marriages, to families, to private and public organizations of 
every kind. When these truths are internalized into habits, they empower people to create a wide 
variety of practices to deal with different situations.

Principles are not values. A gang of thieves can share values, but they are in violation of the 
fundamental principles we're talking about. Principles are the territory. Values are maps. Whenwe 
value correct principles, we have truth -- a knowledge of things as they are. 

Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. 
They're fundamental. They're essentially unarguable because they are self-evident. One way to 
quickly grasp the self-evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to 
live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, 
deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness 
and success. Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or manifested or 
achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and awareness that they exist.

The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws, the more 
accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and 
interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and 
behaviors. 

Principles of Growth and Change 

The glitter of the personality ethic, the massive appeal, is that there is some quick and easy way to 
achieve quality of life-- personal effectiveness and rich, deep relationships with other people-- without 
going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible 

It's symbol without substance. It's the "get rich quick" scheme promising "wealth without work." 
A nd it might even appear to succeed -- but the schemer remains. 

The personality ethic is illusory and deceptive. And trying to get high-quality results with its 
techniques and quick fixes is just about as effective as trying to get to some place in Chicago using a 
map of Detroit. 

I n the words of Erich Fromm, an astute observer of the roots and fruits of the personal ity ethic. 

Today we come across an individual who behaves like an automaton, who does not know or 
understand himself, and the only person that he knows is the person that he is supposed to be, whose 
meaningless chatter has replaced communicative speech, whose synthetic smile has replaced genuine 
laughter, and whose sense of dull despair has taken the place of genuine pain. Two statements may be 
said concerning this individual. One is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality 
which may seem to be incurable. At the same time it may be said of him he does not differ essentially 
from the mill ions of the rest of us who wal k upon this earth. 

In all of life, there are sequential stages of growth and development. A child learns to turn over, to 
sit up, to crawl, and then to walk and run. Each step is important and each one takes time. N o step 
can be skipped. 

This is true in all phases of life, in all areas of development, whether it be learning to play the piano 
or communicate effectively with a working associate. It is true with individuals, with marriages, with 
families, and with organizations. 

Weknow and accept this fact or principleof process in the area of physical things, but to understand 
it in emotional areas, in human relations, and even in the area of personal character is less common and 
more difficult. And even if we understand it, to accept it and to live in harmony with it are even less 
common and more difficult. Consequently, we sometimes look for a shortcut, expecting to be able to 
skip some of these vital steps in order to save time and effort and still reap thedesired result. 

But what happens when we attempt to shortcut a natural process in our growth and development? 
If you are only an average tennis player but decide to play at a higher level in order to make a better 
impression, what will result? Would positive thinking alone enable you to compete effectively against a 
professional? 

What if you were to lead your friends to believe you could play the piano at concert hall level while 
your actual present skill was that of a beginner? 

The answers are obvious. It is simply impossible to violate, ignore, or shortcut this development 
process. It is contrary to nature, and attempting to seek such a shortcut only results in disappointment 
and frustration. 

On a 10-point scale, if I am at level two in any field, and desire to move to level five, I must first take 
the step toward level three. "A thousand-milejourney begins with thefirst step}' and can only betaken 
one step at a ti me.

If you don't let a teacher know what level you are -- by asking a question, or revealing your 
ignorance--you will not learn or grow. You cannot pretend for long, for you will eventually be found 
out. Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education. Thoreau taught, "How can we 
remember our ignorance, which our growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all of the 
ti me?" 

I recall one occasion when two young women, daughters of a friend of mine, came to me tearfully, 
complaining about their father's harshness and lack of understanding. They were afraid to open up 
with their parents for fear of the consequences. And yet they desperately needed their parents' love, 
understanding, and guidance. 

I talked with the father and found that he was intellectually aware of what was happening. But 
while he admitted he had a temper problem, he refused to take responsibility for it and to honestly 
accept the fact that his emotional development level was low. It was more than his pride could 
swal I ow to take the fi rst step toward change. 

To relate effectively with a wife, a husband, children, friends, or working associates, we must learn 
to listen. And this requires emotional strength. Listening involves patience, openness, and thedesire 
to understand -- highly developed qualities of character. It's so much easier to operate from a low 
emotional level and to give high-level advice. 

Our level of development is fairly obvious with tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to 
pretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of character and emotional development. We can "pose" 
and "put on" for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it -- 
at least in public. We might even deceive ourselves. Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of 
what we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well. 

I have seen the consequences of attempting to shortcut this natural process of growth often in the 
business world, where executives attempt to "buy" a new culture of improved productivity, quality, 
morale, and customer service with the strong speeches, smile training, and external interventions, or 
through mergers, acquisitions, and friendly or unfriendly takeovers. But they ignore the low-trust 
climate produced by such manipulations. When these methods don't work, they look for other 
personality ethic techniques that will -- all the time ignoring and violating the natural principles and 
processes on which high-trust culture is based. 

I remember violating this principle myself as a father many years ago. One day I returned home to 
my little girl's third-year birthday party to find her in the corner of the front room, defiantly clutching 
all of her presents, unwilling to let the other children play with them. The first thing I noticed was 
several parents in the room witnessing this selfish display. I was embarrassed, and doubly so because 
at the time I was teaching university classes in human relations. And I knew, or at least felt, the 
expectation of these parents. 

The atmosphere in the room was really charged -- the children were crowding around my little 
daughter with their hands out, asking to play with the presents they had just given, and my daughter 
was adamantly refusing. I said to myself, "Certainly I should teach my daughter to share. The value 
of sharing is one of the most basic things we bel ieve in." 

So I first tried a simple request. "Honey, would you please share with your friends the toys they've 
given you? 

"No," she replied flatly. 

Mysecond method was to use a little reasoning. "Honey,ifyou learn to share your toys with them 
when they are at your home, then when you go to their homes they will sharetheir toys with you." 

Again, the immediate reply was "No!" 

I was becoming a little more embarrassed, for it was evident I was having no influence. The third 
method was bribery. Very softly I said, "Honey, if you share, I've got special surprise for you. I'll 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


give you a piece of gum." 

"I don't want gum!" she exploded. 

Now I was becoming exasperated. For my fourth attempt, I resorted to fear and threat. "Unless 
you share, you will be in real trouble!" 

"I don't care!" she cried. "These are my things. I don't have to share!" 

Fi nal ly, I resorted to force. I merely took some of the toys and gave them to the other kids. "Fi ere, 
kids, play with these." 

But at that moment, I valued the opinion those parents had of me more than the growth and 
development of my child and our relationship together. I simply made an initial judgment that I was 
right; she should share, and she was wrong in not doing so. 

Perhaps I superimposed a higher-level expectation on her simply because on my own scale I was at 
a lower level. I was unable or unwilling to give patience or understanding, so I expected her to give 
things. In an attempt to compensate for my deficiency, I borrowed strength from my position and 
authority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do. 

But borrowing strength builds weakness. It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces 
dependence on external factors to get things done. It builds weakness in the person forced to 
acquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth, and internal discipline. And 
finally, it builds weakness in the relationship. Fear replaces cooperation, and both people involved 
become more arbitrary and defensive. 

And what happens when the source of borrowed strength -- be it superior size or physical strength, 
position, authority, credentials, status symbols, appearance, or past achievements -- changes or is no 
longer there? 

FI ad I been more mature, I could have relied on my own intrinsic strength -- my understanding of 
sharing and of growth and my capacity to love and nurture -- and allowed my daughter to make a free 
choice as to whether she wanted to share or not to share. Perhaps after attempting to reason with her, 
I could have turned the attention of the children to an interesting game, taking all that emotional 
pressure off my child. I've learned that once children gain a sense of real possession, they share very 
naturally, freely, and spontaneously. 

My experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach. When relationships 
are strained and the air charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of 
judgment and rejection. But to take the child alone, quietly, when the relationship is good and to 
discuss the teaching or the value seems to have much greater impact. It may have been that the 
emotional maturity to do that was beyond my level of patience and internal control at the time. 

Perhaps a sense of possessing needs to come before a sense of genuine sharing. M any people who 
give mechanically or refuse to give and share in their marriages and families may never have 
experienced what it means to possess themselves, their own sense of identity and self-worth. Really 
helping our children grow may involve being patient enough to allow them the sense of possession as 
well as being wise enough to teach them the value of giving and providing the example ourselves. 

The Way We See the Problem is the Problem 

People are intrigued when they see good things happening in the lives of individuals, families, and 
organizations that are based on solid principles. They admire such personal strength and maturity, 
such family unity and teamwork, such adaptive synergistic organizational culture. 

And their immediate request is very revealing of their basic paradigm. "Flow do you do it? Teach 
me the techniques." What they're really saying is, "Give me some quick fix advice or solution that will 
relieve the pain in my own situation."

They will find people who will meet their wants and teach these things; and for a short time, skills 
and techniques may appear to work. They may eliminate some of the cosmetic or acute problems 
through social aspirin and band-aids. 

But the underlying chronic condition remains, and eventually new acute symptoms will appear. 
The more people are into quick fix and focus on the acute problems and pain, the more that very 
approach contributes to the underlying chronic condition. 

The way we see the problem is the problem. 

Look again at some of the concerns that introduced this chapter, and at the impact of personality 
ethicthinking. 

I've taken cou rse after course on effecti ve management trai ni ng. I expect a Iot out of my empl oyees 
and I work hard to be friendly toward them and to treat them right. But I don't feel any loyalty from 
them. I think if I were home sick for a day, they'd spend most of their time gabbing at the water 
fountain. Why can't I train them to be independent and responsible--or find employees who can be? 

The personality ethic tells me I could take some kind of dramatic action -- shake things up, make 
heads roll -- that would make my employees shape up and appreciate what they have. Or that I could 
find some motivational training program that would get them committed. Or even that I could hire 
new people that would do a better job. 

But is it possible that under that apparently disloyal behavior, these employees question whether I 
really act in their best interest? Do they feel like I'm treating them as mechanical objects? Is there some 
truth to that? 

Deep inside, is that really the way I see them? Is there a chance the way I look at the people who 
work for me is part of the problem? 

There's so much to do. And there's never enough time. I feel pressured and hassled alI day, every 
day, seven daysa week. I've attended time management seminars and I'vetried half adozen different 
planning systems. They've hel ped some, but I still don't feel I'm living the happy, productive, peaceful 
life I want to live. 

The personality ethic tells me there must be something out there -- some new planner or seminar 
that will help mehandleall these pressures in a more efficient way. 

But is there a chance that efficiency is not the answer? Is getting morethingsdonein less time going 
to make a difference -- or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances 
that seem to control my I ife? 

Could there be something I need to see in a deeper, more fundamental way -- some paradigm within 
myself that affects the way I see my time, my life, and my own nature? 

My marriage has gone flat. We don't fight or anything; we just don't love each other anymore. 
We've goneto counseling; we've tried a number of things, but wejust can't seem to rekindle the feeling 
we used to have. 

The personality ethic tells me there must be some new book or some seminar where people get all 
their feelings out that would help my wife understand me better. Or maybe that it's useless, and only 
anew relationship will providethelovel need. 

But is it possible that my spouse isn't the real problem? Could I be empowering my spouse's 
weaknesses and making my life a function of the way I'm treated? 

Do I have some basic paradigm about my spouse, about marriage, about what love really is, that is 
feeding the problem? 

Can you see how fundamentally the paradigms of the personality ethic affect the very way we see 
our problems as w el I as the way we attempt to solve them? 

Whether people see it or not, many are becoming disillusioned with the empty promises of the 
personality ethic. As I travel around the country and work with organizations, I find that long-term

thinking executives are simply turned off by psyche up psychology and "motivational" speakers who 
have nothing more to share than entertaining stories mingled with platitudes. 

They want substance; they want process. They want more than aspirin and band-aids. They want 
to solve the chronic underlying problems and focus on the principles that bring long-term results. 

A New Level of Thinking 

Albert Einstein observed, 'The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of 
thinking we were at when we created them. 

As we look around us and within us and recognize the problems created as we live and interact 
within the personality ethic, we begin to realize that these are deep, fundamental problems that cannot 
be solved on the superficial level on which they were created. 

We need a new level, a deeper level of thinking -- a paradigm based on the principles that accurately 
describe the territory of effective human being and interacting -- to solve these deep concerns. 

This new level of thinking is what Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is about. It's a 
principle-centered, character-based, "Inside-Out" approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. 

"Inside-Out" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside 
part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. 

It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy 
and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, 
cooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to 
have more freedom, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more 
contributing employee. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. If you want the secondary 
greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character. 

The Inside-Out approach says that Private Victories TM precede Public Victories TM, that making 
and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it isfutile 
to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving 
ourselves. 

Inside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern 
human growth and progress. It's an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms 
of responsible independence and effective interdependence. 

I have had the opportunity to work with many people - wonderful people, talented people, people 
who deeply want to achieve happiness and success, people who are searching, people who are hurting. 
I've worked with business executives, col lege students, church and civic groups, families and marriage 
partners. And in all of my experience, I have never seen lasting solutions to problems, lasting 
happiness and success, that came from the outside in. 

What I have seen result from the outside-in paradigm is unhappy people who feel victimized and 
immobilized, who focus on the weaknesses of other people and the circumstances they feel are 
responsible for their own stagnant situation. I've seen unhappy marriages where each spouse wants 
the other to change, where each is confessing the other's "sins," where each is trying to shape up the 
other. I've seen labor management disputes where people spend tremendous amounts of time and 
energy trying to create legislation that would force peopleto act as though the foundation of trust were 
really there. 

Members of our family have lived in three of the "hottest" spots on earth -- South Africa, Israel, and 
Ireland -- and I believe the source of the continuing problems in each of these places has been the 
dominant social paradigm of outside-in. Each involved group is convinced the problem is "out there" 
and if "they" (meaning others) would "shape up" or suddenly "ship out" of existence, the problem 
would be solved.

Inside-Out is a dramatic Paradigm Shift for most people, largely because of the powerful impact of 
conditioning and the current social paradigm of the personality ethic. 

But from my own experience-- both personal and in working with thousands of other people-- and 
from careful examination of successful individuals and societies throughout history, I am persuaded 
that many of the principles embodied in the Seven Habits are already deep within us, in our conscience 
and our common sense. To recognize and develop them and to use them in meeting our deepest 
concerns, we need to think differently, to shift our paradigms to a new, deeper, "Inside-Out" level. 

As we sincerely seek to understand and integrate these principles into our lives, I am convinced we 
will discover and rediscover the truth ofT. S. Eliot's observation: 

We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we 
began and to know the place for the fi rst ti me. 


The Seven Habits --An Overview 


We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. 

- A ristotl 

Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, 
reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny," the maxim goes. 

Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, 
they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness. 

As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, "Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it 
everyday and soon it cannot be broken." I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. 

I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn't a quick fix. 
It involves a process and a tremendous commitment. 

Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo 11 were transfixed as we saw the first men 
walk on the moon and return to earth. Superlatives such as "fantastic" and "incredible" were 
inadequate to describe those eventful days. But to get there, those astronauts literally had to break out 
of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth. M ore energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift-off, 
in the first few miles of travel, than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles. 

Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull -- more than most people realize or would admit. 
Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or 
selfishness that viol ate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little willpower and 
a few minor changes in our lives. "Lift off" takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the 
gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension. 

Likeany natural force, gravity pull can work with us or against us. The gravity pull of some of our 
habits may currently be keeping us from going where we want to go. But it is also gravity pull that 
keeps our world together, that keeps the planets in their orbits and our universe in order. It is a 
powerful force, and if we use it effectively, we can use the gravity pull of habit to create the 
cohesiveness and order necessary to establish effectiveness in our lives. 

"Habits" Defined 

For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. 
Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And 
desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to 
have all three. 








THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


I may be ineffective in my interactions with my work associates, my spouse, or my children because 
I constantly tell them what I think, but I never really listen to them. Unless I search out correct 
principles of human interaction, I may not even know I need to listen. 

Even if I do know that in order to interact effectively with others I really need to listen to them, I 
may not havetheskill. I may not know how to really listen deeply to another human being. 

But knowing I need to listen and knowing how to listen is not enough. Unless I want to listen, 
unless I have the desire, it won't be a habit in my life. Creating a habit requires work in all three 
dimensions. 

The being/seeing change is an upward process -- being changing, seeing, which in turn changes 
being, and so forth, as we move in an upward spiral of growth. By working on knowledge, skill, and 
desire, we can break through to new levels of personal and interpersonal effectiveness as we break with 
old paradigms that may have been a source of pseudo-security for years. 

It's sometimes a painful process. It's a change that has to be motivated by a higher purpose, by the 
willingness to subordinate what you think you want now for what you want later. But this process 
produces happiness, "the object and design of our existence." Happiness can be defined, in part at least, 
as the fruit of the desi re and abi I ity to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventual ly. 

The M aturity Continuum TM 

The Seven H abits are not a set of separate or piecemeal psyche-up formulas. In harmony with the 
natural laws of growth, they provide an incremental, sequential, highly integrated approach to the 
development of personal and interpersonal effectiveness. They move us progressively on a Maturity 
Continuum from dependence to interdependence. 

We each begin life as an infant, totally dependent on others. We are directed, nurtured, and 
sustained by others. Without this nurturing, we would only live for a few hours or a few days at the 
most. 

Then gradually, over the ensuing months and years, we become more and more independent -- 
physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially -- until eventually we can essentially take care of 
ourselves, becoming inner-directed and self-reliant. 

As we continue to grow and mature, we become increasingly aware that all of nature is 
interdependent, that there is an ecological system that governs nature, including society. We further 
discover that the higher reaches of our nature have to do with our relationships with others -- that 
human life also is interdependent. 

Our growth from infancy to adulthood is in accordance with natural law. And there are many 
dimensions to growth. Reaching our full physical maturity, for example, does not necessarily assure 
us of simultaneous emotional or mental maturity. On the other hand, a person's physical dependence 
does not mean that heor she is mentally or emotionally immature. 

On the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you -- you take care of me; you come 
through for me; you didn't come through; I blame you for the results. 

Independence isthe paradigm of I --1 can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose. 

Interdependence is the paradigm of we -- we can do it: we can cooperate; we can combine our 
tal ents and abi I iti es and create somethi ng greater together. 

Dependent people need others to get what they want. I ndependent people can get what they want 
through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to 
achieve their greatest success. 

If I were physically dependent -- paralyzed or disabled or limited in some physical way -- I would 
need you to help me. If I were emotionally dependent, my sense of worth and security would come 
from your opinion of me. If you didn't like me, it could be devastating. If I were intellectually 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


dependent, I would count on you to do my thinking for me, to think through the issues and problems of 
my life. 

If I were independent, physically, I could pretty well make it on my own. Mentally, I could think 
my own thoughts, I could move from one level of abstraction to another. I could think creatively and 
analytically and organize and express my thoughts in understandable ways. Emotionally, I would be 
validated from within. I would be inner directed. My sense of worth would not be a function of 
being liked or treated well. 

It's easy to see that independence is much more mature than dependence. Independence is a major 
achievement in and of itself. But independence is not supreme. 

Nevertheless, the current social paradigm enthrones independence. It is the avowed goal of many 
individuals and social movements. Most of the self-improvement material puts independence on a 
pedestal, as though communication, teamwork, and cooperation were lesser values. 

Nevertheless, the current social paradigm enthrones independence. It is the avowed goal of many 
individuals and social movements. Most of the self-improvement material puts independence on a 
pedestal, as though communication, teamwork, and cooperation were lesser values. 

But much of our current emphasis on independence is a reaction to dependence-- to having others 
control us, define us, use us, and manipulate us. 

The little understood concept of interdependence appears to many to smack of dependence, and 
therefore, we find people often for selfish reasons, leaving their marriages, abandoning their children, 
and forsaking all kinds of social responsibility-- all in the name of independence. 

The kind of reaction that results in people "throwing off their shackles," becoming "liberated," 
"asserting themselves," and "doing their own thing" often reveals more fundamental dependencies that 
cannot be run away from because they are internal rather than external -- dependencies such as letting 
the weaknesses of other people ruin our emotional lives or feeling victimized by people and events out 
of our control. 

Of course, we may need to change our circumstances. But the dependence problem is a personal 
maturity issue that has little to do with circumstances. Even with better circumstances, immaturity 
and dependence often persist. 

True independence of character empowers us to act rather than be acted upon. It frees us from our 
dependence on circumstances and other people and is a worthy, liberating goal. But it is not the 
ultimate goal in effective living. 

Independent thinking alone is not suited to interdependent reality. Independent people who do 
not have the maturity to think and act interdependent^ may be good individual producers, but they 
won't be good leaders or team players. They're not coming from the paradigm of interdependence 
necessary to succeed in marriage, family, or organizational reality. 

Life is, by nature, highly interdependent. To try to achieve maximum effectiveness through 
independence is I ike trying to play tennis with a golf club-- the tool is not suited to the reality. 

Interdependence is a far more mature, more advanced concept. If I am physically interdependent, I 
am self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that you and I working together can accomplish far more 
than, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. If I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great 
sense of worth within myself, but I also recognize the need for love, for giving, and for receiving love 
from others. If I am intellectually interdependent, I realize that I need the best thinking of other people 
to join with my own. 

As an interdependent person, I have the opportunity to share myself deeply, meaningfully, with 
others, and I have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings. 

I nterdependence is a choice only independent people can make. Dependent people cannot choose 
to become interdependent. They don't have the character to do it; they don't own enough of 
themselves.

That's why Habits 1, 2, and 3 in the following chapters deal with self-mastery. They movea person 
from dependence to independence. They are the "Private Victories," the essence of character growth. 
Private Victories precede Public Victories. You can't invert that process anymore than you can harvest 
a crop before you plant it. It's Inside-Out. 

As you become truly independent, you have the foundation for effective interdependence. You 
have the character base from which you can effectively work on the more personality-oriented "Public 
Victories" of teamwork, cooperation, and communication in Habits 4, 5, and 6. 

That does not mean you have to be perfect in Habits 1, 2, and 3 before working on Habits 4, 5, and 6. 
Understanding the sequence will help you manage your growth more effectively, but I'm not 
suggesting that you put yourself in isolation for several years until you fully develop Habits 1, 2, and 3. 

As part of an interdependent world, you have to relate to that world every day. But the acute 
problems of that world can easily obscure the chronic character causes. Understanding how what you 
are impacts every interdependent interaction will help you to focus your efforts sequentially, in 
harmony with the natural laws of growth. 

Habit 7 is the habit of renewal --aregular, balanced renewal of the four basic dimensions of life. It 
circles and embodies all the other habits. It is the habit of continuous improvement that creates the 
upward spiral of growth that lifts you to new levels of understanding and living each of the habits as 
you come around to them on a progressively higher plane. 

The diagram on the next page is a visual representation of the sequence and the interdependence of 
the Seven Habits, and will be used throughout this book as we explore both the sequential relationship 
between the habits and also their synergy -- how, in relating to each other, they create bold new forms 
of each other that add even more to their value. Each concept or habit will be highlighted as it is 
introduced. 

Effectiveness Defined 

The Seven Habits are habits of effectiveness. Because they are based on principles, they bring the 
maximum long-term beneficial results possible. They become the basis of a person's character, 
creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, 
maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of 
growth. 

They are also habits of effectiveness because they are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in 
harmony with a natural law, a principle I call the"P/ PC Balance," which many people break themselves 
against. This principle can be easily understood by remembering Aesop's fable of the Goose and the 
Golden EggTM. 

This fable is the story of a poor farmer who one day discovers in the nest of his pet goose a glittering 
golden egg. At first, he thinks it must be some kind of trick. But as he starts to throw the egg aside, 
he has second thoughts and takes it in to be appraised instead. 

The egg is pure gold! The farmer can't believe his good fortune. He becomes even more 
incredulous the foil owing day when the experience is repeated. Day after day, he awakens to rush to 
the nest and find another golden egg. He becomes fabulously wealthy; it all seems too good to be true. 

But with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience. Unable to wait day after day for the 
golden eggs, the farmer decides he will kill the goose and get them all at once. But when he opens the 
goose, he finds it empty. There are no golden eggs -- and now there is no way to get any more. The 
farmer has destroyed the goose that produced them. 

But as the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden 
eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose). 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Heart 


If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be 
without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose 
with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the 
goose. 

Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/ PC Balance TM. P stands for production of 
desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces 
the golden eggs. 

Three Kinds of Assets 

Basically, there are three kinds of assets: physical, financial, and human. Let's look at each one in 
turn. 

A few years ago, I purchased a physical asset -- a power lawn mower. I used it over and over again 
without doing anything to maintain it. The mower worked well for two seasons, but then it began to 
break down. When I tried to revive it with service and sharpening, I discovered the engine had lost 
over half its original power capacity. It was essentially worthless. 

Had I invested in PC -- in preserving and maintaining the asset--1 would still be enjoying its P -- the 
mowed lawn. As it was, I had to spend far more time and money replacing the mower than I ever 
would have spent, had I maintained it. It simply wasn't effective. 

In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a 
computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment. Keeping P and PC in balance makes 
a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets. 

It also powerfully impacts the effective use of financial assets. How often do people confuse 
principal with interest? Have you ever invaded principal to increase your standard of living, to get 
more golden eggs? The decreasing principal has decreasing power to produce interest or income. And 
the dwindling capital becomes smaller and smaller until it no longer supplies even our basic needs. 

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don't continually invest in 
improving our own PC, we severely limit our options. We're locked into our present situation, 
running scared of our corporation or our boss's opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. 
Again, it simply isn't effective. 

In the human area, the P/ PC Balance is equally fundamental, but even more important, because 
people control physical and financial assets. 

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than 
they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and 
inconsiderate, neglecting the little kind nesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship. They 
begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own 
position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person. The love, the richness, the 
softness, and spontaneity begin to deteriorate. The goose gets sicker day by day. 

And what about a parent's relationship with a child? When children are little, they are very 
dependent, very vulnerable. It becomes so easy to neglect the PC work -- the training, the 
communicating, the relating, the listening. It's easy to take advantage, to manipulate, to get what you 
want the way you want it -- right now! You're bigger, you're smarter, and you're right! So why not just 
tell them what to do? If necessary, yell at them, inti mi date them, insist on your way. 

Or you can indulge them. You can go for the golden egg of popularity, of pleasing them, giving 
them their way all the time. Then they grow up without a personal commitment to being disciplined 
or responsible. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


Either way -- authoritarian or permissive-- you have the golden egg mentality. You want to have 
your way or you want to be liked. But what happens, meantime, to the goose? What sense of 
responsibility, of self-discipline, of confidence in the ability to make good choices or achieve important 
goals is a child going to have a few years down the road? And what about your relationship? When he 
reaches those critical teenage years, the identity crises, will he know from his experience with you that 
you will listen without judging, that you really, deeply care about him as a person, that you can be 
trusted, no matter what? Will the relationship be strong enough for you to reach him, to communicate 
with him, to influence him? 

Suppose you want your daughter to have a clean room -- that's P, production, the golden egg. And 
suppose you want her to clean it -- that's PC, Production Capability. Your daughter is the goose, the 
asset, that produces the golden egg. 

If you have P and PC in balance, she cleans the room cheerfully, without being reminded, because 
she is committed and has the discipline to stay with the commitment. She is a valuable asset, a goose 
that can produce golden eggs. 

But if your paradigm is focused on Production, on getting the room clean, you might find yourself 
nagging her to do it. You might even escalate your effortsto threatening or yelling, and in your desire 
to get the golden egg, you undermine the health and welfare of the goose. 

Let me share with you an interesting PC experience I had with one of my daughters. We were 
planning a private date, which is something I enjoy regularly with each of my children. We find that 
the antici pation of the date is as sati sfyi ng as the real izati on. 

Sol approached my daughter and said, "Honey, tonight's your night. What do you want to do?" 

"Oh, Dad, that's okay," she replied 

"No, really," I said, "What would you I ike to do?" 

"Well," she finally said, "what I want to do, you don't really want to do." 

"Really, honey," I said earnestly, "I wanttodo it. No matter what, it's your choice." 

"I want to go see Star Wars," she replied. "But I know you don't I ike Star Wars. You slept through 
it before. You don't I ike these fantasy movies. That's okay, Dad." 

"No, honey, if that's what you'd liketodo, I'd liketodo it." 

"Dad, don't worry about it. We don't always have to have this date." She paused and then added, 
"But you know why you don't like Star Wars? It's because you don't understand the philosophy and 
training of a Jed i Knight." 

"What?" 

"You know the things you teach, Dad? Those are the same things that go into the training of ajedi 
Knight." 

"Really? Let's go to Star Wars!" 

And we did. She sat next me and gave me the paradigm. I became her student, her learner. It 
was totally fascinating. I could begin to see out of anew paradigm the whole way ajedi Knight's basic 
philosophy in training is manifested in different circumstances. 

That experience was not a planned P experience; it was the serendipitous fruit of a PC investment. 
It was bonding and very satisfying. But we enjoyed golden eggs, too, as the goose -- the quality of the 
relationship -- was significantly fed. 

Organizational PC 

One of the immensely valuable aspects of any correct principle is that it is valid and applicable in a 
wide variety of circumstances. Throughout this book, I would I ike to share with you someof theways 
in which these principles apply to organizations, including families, as well as to individuals. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

When people fail to respect the P/ PC Balance in their use of physical assets in organizations, they 
decrease organizational effectiveness and often leave others with dying geese. 

For example, a person in charge of a physical asset, such as a machine, may be eager to make a good 
impression on his superiors. Perhaps the company is in a rapid growth stage and promotions are 
coming fast. So he produces at optimum levels -- no downtime, no maintenance. He runs the 
machine day and night. The production is phenomenal, costs are down, and profits skyrocket. 
Within a short time, he's promoted. Golden eggs. 

But suppose you are his successor on the job. You inherit a very sick goose, a machine that, by this 
time, is rusted and starts to break down. You have to invest heavily in downtime and maintenance. 
Costs skyrocket; profits nose-dive. And who gets blamed for the loss of golden eggs? You do. Your 
predecessor liquidated the asset, but the accounting system only reported unit production, costs, and 
profit. 

TheP/ PC Balance is particularly important as it applies to the human assets of an organization --the 
customers and the employees. 

I know of a restaurant that served a fantastic clam chowder and was packed with customers every 
day at lunchtime. Then the business was sold, and the new owner focused on golden eggs -- he 
decided to water down the chowder. For about a month, with costs down and revenues constant, 
profits zoomed. But little by little, the customers began to disappear. Trust was gone, and business 
dwindled to almost nothing. The new owner tried desperately to reclaim it, but he had neglected the 
customers, violated their trust, and lost the asset of customer loyalty. There was no more goose to 
produce the golden egg. 

There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people 
that deal with the customer -- the employees. The PC principle is to always treat your employees 
exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. 

You can buy a person's hand, but you can't buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his 
loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can't buy his brain. That's where his creativity is, his 
ingenuity, his resourcefulness. 

PC work istreating employees as volunteers just as you treat customers as volunteers, because that's 
what they are. They volunteer the best part -- thei r hearts and mi nds. 

I was in a group once where someone asked, "How do you shape up lazy and incompetent 
employees?" One man responded, "Drop hand grenades!" Several others cheered that kind of macho 
management talk, that "shape up or ship out" supervision approach. 

But another person in thegroup asked, "Who picks up the pieces?" 

"No pieces." 

"Well, why don't you do that to your customers?" the other man replied. "Just say, 'Listen, if you're 
not interested in buying, you can just ship out of this place.'" 

He said, "You can't do that to customers." 

"Well, how come you can do it to employees?" 

"Becausethey're in your employ." 

"I see. A re your employees devoted to you? Do they work hard? How's the turnover?" 

"Are you kidding? You can't find good people these days. There's too much turnover, absenteeism, 
moonlighting. People just don't care anymore." 

That focus on golden eggs -- that attitude, that paradigm -- is totally inadequate to tap into the 
powerful energies of the mind and heart of another person. A short-term bottom line is important, but 
it isn't all-important. 

Effectiveness lies in the balance. Excessive focus on P results in ruined health, worn-out machines, 
depleted bank accounts, and broken relationships. Too much focus on PC is like a person who runs 
for three or four hours a day, bragging about the extra 10 years of life it creates, unaware he's spending

them running. Or a person endlessly going to school, never producing, living on other people's golden 
eggs -- the eternal student syndrome. 

To maintain the P/ PC Balance, the balance between the golden egg (Production) and the health and 
welfare of the goose (Production Capability) is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the 
very essence of effectiveness. It balances short term with long term. It balances going for the grade 
and paying the price to get an education. It balances the desire to have a room clean and the building 
of a relationship in which the child is internally committed to do it -- cheerfully, willingly, without 
external supervision. 

It's a principle you can see validated in your own life when you burn the candle at both ends to get 
more golden eggs and wind up sick or exhausted, unableto produce any at all; or when you get a good 
night's sleep and wake up ready to produce throughout the day. 

You can see it when you press to get your own way with someone and somehow feel an emptiness 
in the relationship; or when you really take time to invest in a relationship and you find the desire and 
ability to work together, to communicate, takes a quantum leap. 

The P/ PC Balance is the very essence of effectiveness. It's val idated in every arena of I ife. We can 
work with it or against it, but it's there. It's a lighthouse. It's the definition and paradigm of 
effectiveness upon which theSe/en Habits in this book are based. 

How to Use This Book 

Before we begin work on the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, I would like to suggest two 
Paradigm Shifts that will greatly increase the value you will receivefrom this material. 

First, I would recommend that you not "see" this material as a book, in the sense that it is something 
to read once and put on a shelf. 

You may choose to read it completely through once for a sense of the whole. But the material is 
designed to be a companion in the continual process of change and growth. It is organized 
incrementally and with suggestions for application at the end of each habit so that you can study and 
focus on any particular habit as you are ready. 

As you progress to deeper levels of understanding and implementation, you can go back time and 
again to the principles contained in each habit and work to expand your knowledge, skill, and desire. 

Second, I would suggest that you shift your paradigm of your own involvement in this material 
from the role of I earner to that of teacher. Takean Inside-Out approach, and read with the purpose in 
mind of sharing or discussing what you learn with someone else within 48 hours after you learn it. 

If you had known, for example, that you would be teaching the material on the P/ PC Balance 
principle to someone else within 48 hours, would it have made a difference in your reading experience? 
Try it now as you read the final section in this chapter. Read as though you are going to teach it to 
your spouse, your child, a business associate, or a friend today or tomorrow, while it is still fresh, and 
notice the difference in your mental and emotional process. 

I guarantee that if you approach the material in each of the following chapters in this way, you will 
not only better remember what you read, but your perspective will be expanded, your understanding 
deepened, and your motivation to apply the material increased. 

In addition, as you openly, honestly share what you're learning with others, you may be surprised to 
find that negative labels or perceptions others may have of you tend to disappear. Those you teach 
will see you as a changing, growing person, and will be more inclined to be helpful and supportive as 
you work, perhaps together, to integrate the Seven Habits into your lives. 


What You Can Expect

In the last analysis, as Marilyn Ferguson observed, "No one can persuade another to change. Each 
of us guards a gate of change that can only be opened from the inside. We cannot open the gate of 
another, either by argument or by emotional appeal. 

If you decideto open your "gateof change" to really understand and livethe principles embodied in 
the Seven Habits, I feel comfortablein assuring you several positive things will happen. 

First, your growth with be evolutionary, but the net effect will be revolutionary. Would you not 
agree that the P/ PC Balance principle alone, if fully lived, would transform most individuals and 
organizations? 

The net effect of opening the "gate of change" to the first three habits -- the habits of Private Victory 
-- will be significantly increased self-confidence. You will come to know yourself in a deeper, more 
meaningful way -- your nature, your deepest values and your unique contribution capacity. As you 
live your values, your sense of identity, integrity, control, and inner-directedness will infuse you with 
both exhilaration and peace. You will define yourself from within, rather than by people's opinions or 
by comparisons to others. "Wrong" and "right"will have littleto do with being found out. 

Ironically, you'll find that as you care less about what others think of you; you will care more about 
what others think of themselves and their worlds, including their relationship with you. You'll no 
longer build your emotional life on other people's weaknesses. In addition, you'll find it easier and 
more desirable to change because there is something -- some core deep within -- that is essentially 
changeless. 

As you open yourself to the next three habits-- the habits of Public Victory -- you will discover and 
unleash both the desire and the resources to heal and rebuild important relationships that have 
deteriorated, or even broken. Good relationships will improve -- become deeper, more solid, more 
creative, and more ad venturesome. 

The seventh habit, if deeply internalized, will renew the first six and will make you truly 
independent and capableof effective interdependence. Through it, you can charge your own batteries. 

Whatever your present situation, I assure you that you are not your habits. You can replace old 
patterns of self-defeating behavior with new patterns, new habits of effectiveness, happiness, and 
trust-based relationships. 

With genuine caring, I encourage you to open the gate of change and growth as you study these 
habits. Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it's holy ground. There's no greater 
investment. 

It's obviously not a quick fix. But I assure you, you will feel benefits and see immediate payoffs 
that will be encouraging. In the words of Thomas Paine, "That which we obtain too easily, we esteem 
too lightly. It is dearness only which gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper 
price on its goods."

H abit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Visio 


I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by 
conscious endeavor. 

- Henry David Thorea 

As you read this book, try to stand apart from yourself. Try to project your consciousness upward 
into a corner of the room and see yourself, in your mind's eye, reading. Can you look at yourself 
almost as though you were someone else? 

Now try something else. Think about the mood you are now in. Can you identify it? What are 
you feeling? How would you describe your present mental state 

Now think for a minute about how your mind is working. Is it quick and alert? Do you sense that 
you are torn between doing this mental exercise and evaluating the point to be made out of it? 

Your ability to do what you just did is uniquely human. Animals do not possess this ability. We 
call it "self-awareness" or the ability to think about your very thought process. This is the reason why 
man has dominion over all things in the world and why he can make significant advances from 
generation to generation. 

This is why we can evaluate and learn from others' experiences as well as our own. This is also 
why we can make and break our habits. 

We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. The very fact 
that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world. 
Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we "see" ourselves -- our paradigm, 
the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but 
also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. 

In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and how wesee others) into account, we will be unable 
to understand how others see and feel about themselves and their world. Unaware, we will beunable 
to understand how others see and feel about themselves and their world. Unaware, we will project 
our intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective. 

This significantly limits our personal potential and our ability to relate to others as well. But 
because of the unique human capacity of self-awareness, we can examine our paradigms to determine 
whether they are reality- or principle-based or if they area function of conditioning and conditions. 

The Social M irror 

If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from the social mirror -- from the current social 
paradigm and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of the people around us -- our view of 
ourselves is I ike the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival. 

"You're never on time." 

"Why can't you ever keep things in order?" 

"You must bean artist!" 

"You eat I ike a horse!" 

"I can't believe you won!"

'This is so simple. Why can't you understand?" 

These visions are disjointed and out of proportion. They are often more projections than reflections, 
projecting the concerns and character weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately 
ref I ecti ng w hat we are. 

The reflection of the current social paradigm tells us we are largely determined by conditioning and 
conditions. While we have acknowledged the tremendous power of conditioning in our lives, to say 
that we are determined by it, that we have no control over that influence, creates quite a different map. 

There are actually three social maps -- three theories of determinism widely accepted, independently 
or in combination, to explain the nature of man. Genetic determinism basically says your 
grandparents did it to you. That's why you have such a temper. Your grandparents had short 
tempers and it'sin your DNA. It just goes through the generations and you inherited it. In addition, 
you're Irish, and that's the nature of Irish people. 

Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood 
experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That's why 
you're afraid to be in front of a group. It's the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly 
guilty if you make a mistake because you "remember" deep inside the emotional scripting when you 
were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You "remember" the emotional punishment, the 
rejection, the comparison with somebody el sew hen you didn't perform as well as expected. 

Environmental determinism basically says your boss is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty 
teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment 
is responsible for your situation. 

Each of these maps is based on the stimulus/ response theory we most often think of in connection 
with Pavlov's experiments with dogs. The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a 
particular way to a particular stimulus. 

How accurately and functionally do these deterministic maps describe the territory? How clearly do 
these mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do they become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based 
on principles we can validate within ourselves? 

Between Stimulus and Response 

In answer to those questions, let me share with you the catalytic story of Viktor Frankl. 

Frankl was a determinist raised in the tradition of Freudian psychology, which postulates that 
whatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your 
whole life. The limits and parameters of your lifeareset, and, basically, you can't do much about it. 

Frankl was also a psychiatrist and ajew. He was imprisoned in the death camps of Nazi Germany, 
where he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even 
repeat them. 

His parents, his brother, and his wife died in the camps or were sent to the gas ovens. Except for 
his sister, his entire family perished. Frankl himself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, 
never knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be 
among the "saved" w ho wou I d remove the bod i es or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. 

One day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called "the 
last of the human freedoms" -- the freedom his N azi captors could not take away. They could control 
his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a 
self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement. H is basic identity was intact. 
He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him. Between what happened to 
him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was hisfreedom or power to choose that response. 

In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would project himself into different circumstances, such as 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyFl^Heort 


lecturing to his students after his release from the death camps. He would describe himself in the 
classroom, in his mind's eye, and give his students the lessons hewas learning during his very torture. 

Through a series of such disciplines -- mental, emotional, and moral, principally using memory and 
imagination -- he exercised his small, embryonic freedom until it grew larger and larger, until he had 
more freedom than his Nazi captors. They had more liberty, more options to choose from in their 
environment; but he had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options. He became an 
inspiration to those around him, even to some of the guards. He helped others find meaning in their 
suffering and dignity in their prison existence. 

In the midst of the most degrading circumstances imaginable, Frankl used the human endowment of 
self-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and 
response, man has the freedom to choose. 

Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human. In addition to 
self-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. 
We have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our 
behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions arein harmony with them. And 
we have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. 

Even the most intelligent animals have none of these endowments. To use a computer metaphor, 
they are programmed by instinct and/ or training. They can be trained to be responsible, but they can't 
take responsibility for that training; in other words, they can't direct it. They can't change the 
programming. They're not even aware of it. 

But because of our unique human endowments, we can write new programs for ourselves totally 
apart from our instincts and training. This is why an animal's capacity is relatively limited and man's 
is unlimited. But if we live like animals, out of our own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out 
of ou r col I ecti ve memory, w e too will be I i mi ted. 

The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, 
dogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people. While this may meet certain criteria of some researchers 
because it seems measurableand predictable, the history of mankind and our own self-awareness tel I us 
that this map doesn't describe the territory at all! 

Our unique human endowments lift us above the animal world. The extent to which we exercise 
and develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential. Between 
stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose. 

"Proactivity" Defined 

In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from 
which he began to develop the first and most basic habit of a highly effective person in any 
environment, the habit of Proactivity. 

While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won't 
find in most dictionaries. It means more than merely taking initiative. It means that as human beings, 
we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. 
We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things 
happen. 

Look at the word responsibility -- "response-ability" -- the ability to choose your response. Highly 
proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or 
conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on 
values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. 

Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives area function of conditioning and conditions, it is 
because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


In making such a choice, we become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by their physical 
environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn't, it affects their attitude and their 
performance. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines 
makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality 
work, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. 

Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the "social weather." When people 
treat them well, they feel well; when people don't, they become defensive or protective. Reactive 
people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other 
people to control them. 

The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive 
people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people 
aredriven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. 

Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. 
But thei r response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response. 

As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, "No one can hurt you without your consent." In the words of 
Gandhi, 'They cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them." It is our willing 
permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the 
fi rst place. 

I admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of 
explaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else's behavior. But until a person can 
say deeply and honestly, "I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday," that person 
cannot say, "I choose otherwise." 

Once in Sacramento when I was speaking on the subject of Proactivity, a woman in the audience 
stood up in the middle of my presentation and started talking excitedly. It was a large audience, and 
as a number of people turned to look at her, she suddenly became aware of what she was doing, grew 
embarrassed and sat back down. But she seemed to find it difficult to restrain herself and started 
talking to the people around her. She seemed so happy. 

I could hardly wait for a break to find out what had happened. When it finally came, I 
immediately went to her and asked ifshewould be willing to share her experience. 

"You just can't imagine what's happened to me!" she exclaimed. "I'm a full-time nurse to the most 
miserable, ungrateful man you can possibly imagine. Nothingl do is good enough for him. Henever 
expresses appreciation; he hardly even acknowledges me. He constantly harps at me and finds fault 
with everything I do. This man has made my life miserable and I often take my frustration out on my 
family. The other nurses feel the same way. We almost pray for his demise. 

"And for you to have the gall to stand up there and suggest that nothing can hurt me, that no one 
can hurt me without my consent, and that I have chosen my own emotional life of being miserable -- 
well,therewasjustnoway I could buy into that. 

"But I kept thinking about it. I really went inside myself and began to ask, 'Do I have the power to 
choose my response?" 

"When I finally realized that I do have that power, when I swallowed that bitter pill and realized 
that I had chosen to be miserable, I also real ized that I could choose not to be miserable. 

"At that moment I stood up. I felt as though I was being let out of San Quentin. I wanted to yell 
to the whole world, 'I am free! I am let out of prison! No longer am I going to be controlled by the 
treatment of some person.'" 

It's not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. Of course, things 
can hurt us physically or economically and can cause sorrow. But our character, our basic identity, 
does not have to be hurt at all. In fact, our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge 
our character and develop the internal powers, the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


future and to inspire others to do so as well. 

Frankl is one of many who have been able to develop the personal freedom in difficult 
circumstances to lift and inspire others. The autobiographical accounts of Vietnam prisoners of war 
provide additional persuasive testimony of the transforming power of such personal freedom and the 
effect of the responsible use of that freedom on the prison culture and on the prisoners, both then and 
now. 

We have all known individuals in very difficult circumstances, perhaps with a terminal illness or a 
severe physical handicap, who maintain magnificent emotional strength. How inspired we are by 
their integrity! Nothing has a greater, longer lasting impression upon another person than the 
awareness that someone has transcended suffering, has transcended circumstance, and is embodying 
and expressing a value that inspires and ennobles and lifts life. 

One of the most inspiring times Sandra and I have ever had took place over a four-year period with 
a dear friend of ours named Carol, who had a wasting cancer disease. She had been one of Sandra's 
bridesmaids, and they had been best friends for over 25 years. 

When Carol was in the very last stages of the disease, Sandra spent time at her bedside helping her 
write her personal history. She returned from those protracted and difficult sessions almost transfixed 
by admiration for her friend's courage and her desire to write special messages to be given to her 
children at different stages in their lives. 

Carol would takeas little pain-killing medication as possible so that she had full access to her mental 
and emotional faculties. Then she would whisper into a tape recorder or to Sandra directly as she took 
notes. Carol was so proactive, so brave, and so concerned about others that she became an enormous 
source of inspiration to many people around her. 

I'll never forget the experience of looking deeply into Carol's eyes the day before she passed away 
and sensing out of that deep hollowed agony a person of tremendous intrinsic worth. I could see in 
her eyes a life of character, contribution, and service as well as love, concern, and appreciation. 

M any ti mes over the years, I have asked groups of people how many have ever experienced being in 
the presence of a dying individual who had a magnificent attitude and communicated love and 
compassion and served in unmatchable ways to the very end. Usually, about one-fourth of the 
audience respond in the affirmative. I then ask how many of them will never forget these individuals 
-- how many were transformed, at least temporarily, by the inspiration of such courage, and were 
deeply moved and motivated to more noble acts of service and compassion. The same people respond 
again, almost inevitably. 

Viktor Frankl suggests that there are three central values in life -- the experiential, or that which 
happens to us; the creative, or that which webring into existence; and theattitudinal, or our response in 
difficult circumstances such as terminal illness. 

My own experience with people confirms the point Frankl makes -- that the highest of the three 
values is attitudinal, in the paradigm of reframing sense. In other words, what matters most is how we 
respond to what we experience in life. 

Difficult circumstances often create Paradigm Shifts, whole new frames of reference by which people 
see the world and themselves and others in it, and what life is asking of them. Their larger perspective 
reflects the attitudinal values that lift and inspire us all. 

Taking the Initiative 

Our basic nature is to act, and not beaded upon. As well as enabling us to choose our response to 
particular circumstances, this empowers us to create circumstances 

Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious, or aggressive. It does mean recognizing 
our responsibility to make things happen.

Over the years, I have frequently counseled people who wanted better jobs to show more initiati ve¬ 
to take interest and aptitude tests, to study the industry, even the specific problems the organizations 
they are interested in are facing, and then to develop an effective presentation showing how their 
abilities can help solve the organization's problem. It's called "solution selling," and is a key paradigm 
in business success. 

The response is usually agreement - most people can see how powerfully such an approach would 
affect their opportunities for employment or advancement. But many of them fail to take the 
necessary steps, the initiative, to make it happen. 

"I don't know where to go to take the interest and aptitude test." 

"How do I study industry and organizational problems? Noonewantsto help me." 

Many people wait for something to happen or someone to take care of them. But people who end 
up with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, 
who seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary, consistent with correct principles, to get the job 
done. 

Whenever someone in our family, even one of the younger children, takes an irresponsible position 
and waits for someone else to makethings happen or provide a solution, wetell them, "Use your R and 
I!" (resourcefulness and initiative). In fact, often before we can say it, they answer their own 
complaints, "I know - use my R and I!" 

Holding people to the responsible course is not demeaning; it is affirming. Proactivity is part of 
human nature, and although the proactive muscles may be dormant, they are there. By respecting the 
proactive nature of other people, we provide them with at least one clear, undistorted reflection from 
the social mirror. 

Of course, the maturity level of the individual has to be taken into account. We can't expect high 
creative cooperation from those who are deep into emotional dependence. But we can, at least, affirm 
their basic nature and create an atmosphere where people can seize opportunities and solve problems in 
an increasingly self-reliant way. 

A ct or be A cted U pon 

The difference between people who exercise initiative and those who don't is literally the difference 
between night and day. I'm not talking about a 25 to 50 percent difference in effectiveness; I'm talking 
about a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others. 

It takes initiative to create the P/ PC Balance of effectiveness in your life. It takes initiative to 
develop the Seven Habits. As you study the other six habits, you will see that each depends on the 
development of your proactive muscles. Each puts the responsibility on you to act. If you waitto be 
acted upon, you will be acted upon. And growth and opportunity consequences attend either road. 

At one time I worked with a group of people in the home improvement industry, representatives 
from 20 different organizations who met quarterly to share their numbers and problems in an 
uninhibited way. 

This was during a time of heavy recession, and the negative impact on this particular industry was 
even heavier than ontheeconomy in general. These people were fairly discouraged as we began. 

The first day, our discussion question was "What's happening to us? What's the stimulus?" Many 
things were happening. The environmental pressures were powerful. There was widespread 
unemployment, and many of these people were laying off friends just to maintain the viability of their 
enterprises. By theend of theday, everyone was even more discouraged. 

The second day, we addressed the question, "What's going to happen in the future?" We studied 
environmental trends with the underlying reactive assumption that those things would create their 
future. By the end of the second day, we were even more depressed. Things were going to get worse 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


before they got better, and everyone knew it. 

So on the third day, we decided to focus on the proactive question, "What is our response? What are 
we going to do? How can we exercise initiative in this situation?" In the morning we talked about 
managing and reducing costs. In the afternoon we discussed increasing market share. We 
brainstormed both areas, then concentrated on several very practical, very doablethings. A new spirit 
of excitement, hope, and proactive awareness concluded the meetings. 

At the every end of the third day, we summarized the results of the conference in a three-part 
answer to the question, "How's business?" 

Part one: What's happening to us is not good, and the trends suggest that it will get worse before it 
gets better 

Part two: But what we are causing to happen isvery good, for we are better managing and reducing 
our costs and increasing our market share 

Part three: Therefore, business is better than ever 

Now what would a reactive mind say to that? "Oh, come on. Face facts. You can only carry this 
positive thin king and self-psych approach so far. Sooner or later you have to face reality." 

But that's the difference between positive thinking and proactivity. We did face reality. Wefaced 
the reality of the current circumstance and of future projections. But we also faced the reality that we 
had the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections. N ot facing reality 
would have been to accept the idea that what's happening in our environment had to determine us. 

Businesses, community groups, organizations of every kind -- including families -- can be proactive. 
They can combine the creativity and resourcefulness of proactive individuals to create a proactive 
culture within the organization. The organization does not have to be at the mercy of the environment; 
it can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values and purposes of the individuals involved. 

Listening to our Language 

Because our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we use our self-awareness to 
examine them, we can often see in them the nature of our underlying maps. Our language, for 
example, is a very real indicator of the degree to which we see ourselves as proactive people. 

The language of reactive people absolves them of responsi bility. 

'That's me. That's just the way I am." I am determined. There's nothing I can do about it. 

"He makes me so mad!" I'm not responsible. My emotional life is governed by something outside 
my control. 

"I can't do that. I just don't have the time." Something outside me-- limited time-- is controlling 
me. 

"If only my wife were more patient." Someone else's behavior is limiting my effectiveness. 

"I have to do it." Circumstances or other people are forcing me to do what I do. I'm not free to 
choose my own actions. 

Reactive Language: There's nothing I can do. That's just the way I am. He makes me so mad. 
They won't allow that. I have to do that. I can't. I must. If only. 

Proactive Language: Let's look at our alternatives. I can choose a different approach. I control 
my own feelings. I can create an effective presentation. I will choose an appropriate response. I 
choose. I prefer. I will. 

That language comes from a basic paradigm of determinism. And the whole spirit of it is the 
transfer of responsibility. I am not responsible, not able to choose my response. 

One time a student asked me, "Will you excuse me from class? I have to goon atennistrip." 

"You have to go, or you choose to go?" I asked. 

"I really have to," he exclaimed.

"What will happen if you don't?" 

"Why, they'll kick me off the team." 

"How would you I ike that consequence?" 

"I wouldn't." 

"I n other words, you choose to go because you want the consequence of stayi ng on the team. What 
will happen if you miss my class?" 

"I don't know." 

'Think hard. What do you think would bethe natural consequenceof not coming to class?" 

"You wouldn't kick me out, would you?" 

'That would be a social consequence. That would be artificial. If you don't participate on the 
tennis team, you don't play. That's natural. Butif you don't come to class, what would bethenatural 
consequence?" 

"I guess I'll miss the learning." 

'That's right. So you have to weigh that consequence against the other consequence and make a 
choice. I know if it were me, I'd choose to go on the tennis trip. But never say you have to do 
anything." 

"I choose to go on the tennis trip," he meekly replied. 

"And miss my class?" I replied in mock disbelief. 

A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People 
become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined, and they produce evidence to support the 
belief. They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, notin charge of their life or their destiny. 
They blame outsideforces -- other people, circumstances, even the stars -- for their own situation. 

At one seminar where I was speaking on the concept of proactivity, a man came up and said, 
"Stephen, I like what you're saying. But every situation is so different. Look at my marriage. I'm 
really worried. My wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I 
guess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me. What can I do?" 

'The feeling isn't there anymore?" I asked. 

'That's right," he reaffirmed. "And we havethreechildren we're really concerned about. What do 
you suggest?" 

"Loveher," I replied. 

"I told you, thefeeling just isn't there anymore." 

"Love her." 

"You don't understand. Thefeeling of lovejust isn't there." 

'Then love her. If thefeeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her." 

"But how do you love when you don't love?" 

"My friend, love is a verb. Love-- thefeeling -- is a fruit of love the verb. So love her. Sacrifice. 
Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. A re you willing to do that?" 

In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb. Reactive people make it a feeling. 
They'redriven by feelings. Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, 
that we are a product of our feelings. But the Hollywood script does not describe the reality. If our 
feelings control our actions, it is because we have abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to 
do so. 

Proactive people make love a verb. Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving 
of self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the world. If you want to study love, study those who 
sacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return. If you are a parent, look at the 
love you have for the children you sacrificed for. Love is a value that is actualized through loving 
actions. Proactive people subordinate feelings to values. Love, thefeeling, can berecaptured.

Circle of Concern. Circle of Influence. 

Another excellent way to become more self-aware regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look 
at where we focus our time and energy. We each have a wide range of concerns -- our health, our 
children, problems at work, the national debt, nuclear war. We could separate those from things in 
which we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a "Circleof Concern. 

As we look at those things within our Circle of Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some 
things over which we have no real control and others that we can do something about. We could 
identify those concerns in the latter group by circumscribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence. 
By determining which of these two circles is the focus of most of our time and energy, we can discover 
much about the degree of our proactivity. 

Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do 
something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their 
Circleof Influence to increase. 

Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the 
weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have 
no control. Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes, reactive language, and increased 
feelings of victimization. The negative energy generated by that focus, combined with neglect in areas 
they could do something about, causes their Circleof Influence to shrink. 

As long as we are working in our Circleof Concern, we empower the things within it to control us. 
We aren't taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change. 

Earlier, I shared with you the story of my son who was having serious problems in school. Sandra 
and I were deeply concerned about his apparent weaknesses and about the way other people were 
treating him. 

But those things were in our Circleof Concern. As long as we focused our efforts on those things, 
we accomplished nothing, except to increase our own feelings of inadequacy and helplessness and to 
rei nforce our son's dependence. 

It was only when we went to work in our Circle of Influence, when we focused on our own 
paradigms, that we began to create a positive energy that changed ourselves and eventually influenced 
our son as well. By working on ourselves instead of worrying about conditions, we were able to 
influence the conditions. 

Because of position, wealth, role, or relationships, there are some circumstances in which a person's 
Circleof Influence is larger than hisor her Circleof Concern. 

This situation reflects on a self-inflicted emotional myopia -- another reactive selfish life-style 
focused in the Circle of Concern. 

Though they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people have a Circle of 
Concern that is at least as big as their Circle of Influence, accepting the responsibility to use their 
i nf I uence effecti vel y. 

D i rect, I nd i rect, and N o C ontrol 

The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own 
behavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems wecan 
do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities). The proactive approach puts the first step 
in the solution of all three kinds of problems within our present Circle of Influence. 

Direct control problems are solved by working on our habits. They are obviously within our Circle 
of Influence. These are the "PrivateVictories" of Habits 1, 2, and 3. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


Indirect control problems are solved by changing our methods of influence. These are the "Public 
Victories" of Habits 4, 5, and 6. I have personally identified over 30 separate methods of human 
influence -- as separate as empathy is from confrontation, as separate as example is from persuasion. 
Most people have only three or four of these methods in their repertoire, starting usually with 
reasoning, and, if that doesn't work, moving to flight or fight. How liberating it is to accept the idea 
that I can learn new methods of human influence instead of constantly trying to use old ineffective 
methods to "shape up" someone else! 

No control problems involve taking the responsibility to change the line on the bottom on our face -- 
to smile, to genuinely and peacefully accept these problems and learn to live with them, even though 
we don't like them. In this way, we do not empower these problems to control us. We share in the 
spirit embodied in the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer, "Lord, give me the courage to change the things 
which can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the 
wisdom to know the difference." 

Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no control, we have in our hands the first step to the 
solution. Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our 
no control problems are all within our Circleof Influence. 

Expanding the Circle of Influence 

It is inspiring to realize that in choosing our response to circumstance, we powerfully affect our 
circumstance. When we change one part of the chemical formula, we change the nature of the results 

I worked with one organization for several years that was headed by a very dynamic person. He 
could read trends. He was creative, talented, capable, and brilliant -- and everyone knew it. But he 
had a very dictatorial style of management. He tended to treat people like "gofers," as if they didn't 
have any judgment. H is manner of speaking to those who worked in the organization was, "Go for 
this; go for that; now do this; now dothat-- I'll make the decisions. 

The net effect was that he al ienated al most the entire executive team surroundi ng him. They would 
gather in the corridors and complain to each other about him. Their discussion was all very 
sophisticated, very articulate, as if they were trying to help the situation. But they did it endlessly, 
absolving themselves of responsibility in the name of the president's weaknesses. 

"You can't imagine what's happened this time," someone would say. 'The other day he went into 
my department. I had everything all laid out. But he came in and gave totally different signals. 
Everything I'd done for months was shot, just like that. I don't know how I'm supposed to keep 
working for him. How long will it be until he retires?" 

"He's only fifty-nine," someone else would respond. "Do you think you can survive for six more 
years?" 

"I don't know. He's the kind of person they probably won't retire anyway." 

But one of the executives was proactive. He was driven by values, not feelings. Hetook initiative 
-- he anticipated, he empathized, he read the situation. He was not blind to the president's weaknesses; 
but instead of criticizing them, he would compensate for them. Where the president was weak in his 
style, he'd try to buffer his own people and make such weaknesses irrelevant. And he'd work with the 
president's strengths -- his vision, talent, creativity. 

This man focused on his Circle of Influence. He was treated like a gofer, also. But he would do 
more than what was expected. He anticipated the president's need. He read with empathy the 
president's underlying concern, so when he presented information, he also gave his analysis and his 
recommendations based on that analysis. 

As I sat one day with the president in an advisory capacity, he said, "Stephen, I just can't believe 
what this man has done. He's not only given me the information I requested, but he's provided 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


additional information that's exactly what we needed. He even gave me his analysis of it in terms of 
my deepest concerns, and a list of his recommendations. 

'The recommendations are consistent with the analysis, and the analysis is consistent with the data. 
He's remarkable! What a relief not to have to worry about this part of the business." 

At the next meeting, it was "go for this" and "go for that" to alI the executives but one. To this man, 
itwas "What's your opinion?" HisCircleof Influence had grown 

This caused quite a stir in the organization. The reactive minds in the executive corridors began 
shooting their vindi dive ammunition at this proactive man. 

It's the natureof reactive peopleto absolve themselves of responsibility. It's so much safer to say, "I 
am not responsible." If I say "I am responsible," I might have to say, "I am irresponsible." It would be 
very hard for me to say that I have the power to choose my response and that the response I have 
chosen has resulted in my involvement in a negative, collusive environment, especially if for years I 
have absolved myself of responsi bil ity for results in the name of someone else's weaknesses. 

So these executives focused on finding more information, more ammunition, more evidence as to 
why they weren't responsible. 

But this man was proactive toward them, too. Little by little, his Circle of Influence toward them 
grew also. It continued to expand to the extent that eventually no one made any significant moves in 
the organization without that man's involvement and approval, including the president. But the 
president did not feel threatened because this man's strength complemented his strength and 
compensated for his weaknesses. So he had the strength of two people, a complementary team. 

This man's success was not dependent on his circumstances. Many others were in the same 
situation. It was his chosen response to those circumstances, his focus on his Circle of Influence, that 
mad e the d i fference. 

There are some people who interpret "proactive" to mean pushy, aggressive, or insensitive; but that 
isn't the case at all. Proactive people aren't pushy. They're smart, they're value driven, they read 
reality, and they know what's needed. 

Look at Gandhi. While his accusers were in the legislative chambers criticizing him because he 
wouldn't join in their Circle of Concern rhetoric condemning the British Empire for their subjugation of 
the Indian people, Gandhi was out in the rice paddies, quietly, slowly, imperceptibly expanding his 
Circleof Influence with the field laborers. A ground swell of support, of trust, of confidence foil owed 
him through the countryside. Though he held no office or political position, through compassion, 
courage, fasting, and moral persuasion he eventually brought England to its knees, breaking political 
domination of 300 million people with the power of his greatly expanded Circleof Influence. 

The "H ave's" and the "Be's" 

Oneway to determine which circle our concern is in is to distinguish between the have's and thebe's. 
The Circle of Concern is filled with the have's 

"I'll be happy when I have my house paid off." 

"If only I had a boss who wasn't such a dictator." 

"If only I had a more patient husband." 

"If I had more obedient kids." 

"If I had my degree." 

"If I could just have more time to myself." 

The Circle of Influence is filled with the be's -- I can be more patient, be wise, be loving. It's the 
character focus. 

Anytime we think the problem is "out there," that thought is the problem. We empower what's out 
there to control us. The change paradigm is "outside-in" -- what's out there has to change before we 




THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


can change. 

The proactive approach is to change from the Inside-Out: to be different, and by being different, to 
effect positive change in what's out there --1 can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be 
more creative, I can be more cooperative. 

One of my favorite stories is one in the Old Testament, part of the fundamental fabric of the 
Judeo-Christian tradition. It's the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers 
at the age of 17. Can you imagine how easy it would have been for him to languish in self-pity as a 
servant of Potiphar, to focus on the weaknesses of his brothers and his captors and on all he didn't have? 
But Joseph was proactive. He worked on be. And within a short period of time, he was running 
Potiphar's household. He was in charge of all that Potiphar had because the trust was so high. 

Then the day came when Joseph was caught in a difficult situation and refused to compromise his 
integrity. As a result, he was unjustly imprisoned for 13 years. But again he was proactive. He 
worked on the inner circle, on being instead of having, and soon he was running the prison and 
eventually the entire nation of Egypt, second only to the Pharaoh. 

I know this idea is a dramatic Paradigm Shift for many people. It is so much easier to blame other 
people, conditioning, or conditions for our own stagnant situation. But we are responsible -- 
"response-able" -- to control our lives and to powerfully influence our circumstances by working on be, 
on what we are. 

If I have a problem in my marriage, what do I really gain by continually confessing my wife's sins? 
By saying I'm not responsible, I make myself a powerless victim; I immobilize myself in a negative 
situation. I also diminish my ability to influence her -- my nagging, accusing, critical attitude only 
makes her feel validated in her own weakness. My criticism is worse than the conduct I want to 
correct. My ability to positively impact the situation withers and dies. 

If I really want to improve my situation, I can work on the one thing over which I have control -- 
myself. I can stop trying to shape up my wife and work on my own weaknesses. I can focus on being 
a great marriage partner, a source of unconditional love and support. Hopefully, my wife will feel the 
power of proactive example and respond in kind. But whether she does or doesn't, the most positive 
way I can influence my situation is to work on myself, on my being. 

There are so many ways to work in the Circle of Influence -- to be a better listener, to be a more 
loving marriage partner, to be a better student, to be a more cooperative and dedicated employee. 
Sometimes the most proactive thing wecan do isto be happy, just to genuinely smile. Happiness, like 
unhappiness, is a proactive choice. There are things, likethe weather, that our Circle of Influence will 
never include. But as proactive people, wecan carry our own physical or social weather with us. We 
can be happy and accept those thi ngs that at present we can't control, whi le we focus our efforts on the 
things that wecan. 

The Other End of the Stick 

Before we totally shift our life focus to our Circle of Influence, we need to consider two things in our 
Circle of Concern that merit deeper thought -- consequences and mistakes. 

While weare free to choose our actions, weare not free to choose the consequences of those actions. 
Consequences are governed by natural law. They are out in the Circle of Concern. Wecan decideto 
step in front of a fast-moving train, but we cannot decide what will happen when the train hits us. 

We can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings. While the social consequences of that 
decision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our 
basic character are a fixed result. 

Our behavior is governed by principles. Living in harmony with them brings positive 
consequences; violating them brings negative consequences. Weare free to choose our response in any 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


situation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence. "When we pick up one end of the 
stick, we pick up the other." 

Undoubtedly, there have been times in each of our lives when we have picked up what we later felt 
was the wrong stick. Our choices have brought consequences we would rather have lived without. If 
we had the choice to make over again, we would make it differently. We call these choices mistakes, 
and they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought. 

For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past 
mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can't recall them, we can't undo them, we can't 
control the consequences that came as a result. 

As a college quarterback, one of my sons learned to snap his wristband between plays as a kind of 
mental checkoff whenever he or anyone made a "setting back" mistake, so the last mistake wouldn't 
affect the resolve and execution of the next play. 

The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it. 
This literally turns a failure into a success. "Success," said IBM founder T. J. Watson, "is on the far 
side of failure." 

But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mistake of a different order. 
It usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-justifying path, often involving rationalization (rational 
lies) to self and to others. This second mistake, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it 
disproportionate importance, and causes far deeper injury to self. 

It is not what others do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most; it is our response to those 
things. Chasing after the poisonous snake that bites us will only drive the poison through our entire 
system. 11 i s far better to take measures i mmed iately to get the poi son out. 

Our response to any mi stake affects the quality of the next moment. It is important to immediately 
admit and correct our mistakes so that they have no power over that next moment and we are 
empowered again. 

Making and Keeping Commitments 

At the very heart of our Circle of Influence is our ability to make and keep commitments and 
promises. The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those 
commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity. 

It is also the essence of our growth. Through our human endowments of self-awareness and 
conscience, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for i mprovement, areas of talent that could 
be developed, areas that need to be changed or eliminated from our lives. Then, as we recognize and 
use our imagination and independent will to act on that awareness -- making promises, setting goals, 
and being true to them -- we build the strength of character, the being, that makes possible every other 
positive thing in our lives. 

It is here that wefind two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. We can make 
a promise -- and keep it. Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it. As we make and keep 
commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the 
awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own 
lives. By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes 
greater than our moods. 

The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits 
of effectiveness. Knowledge, skill, and desire are all within our control. We can work on any one to 
improve the balance of the three. As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply 
internalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move 
us in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives.

Proactivity: The 30-Day Test 

We don't have to go through the death camp experience of Frankl to recognize and develop our own 
proactivity. It is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle 
the extraordinary pressures of life. It's how we make and keep commitments, how we handle a traffic 
jam, how we respond to an irate customer or a disobedient child. It's how we view our problems and 
where we focus our energies. It's the language we use. 

I would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days. Simply try it and see what 
happens. For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence. Make small commitments and keep 
them. Be a light, not a judge. Be a model, not a critic. Be part of the solution, not part of the 
problem. 

Try it in your marriage, in your family, in your job. Don't argue for other people's weaknesses. 
Don't argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it -- 
immediately. Don't get into a blaming, accusing mode. Work on things you have control over. 
Work on you. On be. 

Look at the weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation. It's not what they're not doing 
or should be doing that's the issue. The issue is your own chosen response to the situation and what 
you should be doing. If you start to think the problem is "out there," stop yourself. That thought is 
the problem. 

People who exercise their embryonic freedom day after day will, little by little, expand that freedom. 
People who do not will find that it withers until they are literally "being lived." They are acting out the 
scripts written by parents, associates, and society. 

We are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, 
for most of our circumstances. 

Samuel Johnson observed: "Thefountain of content must spring up in the mind, and he who hath so 
little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition, 
will waste his life in fruitless efforts and multiply the grief he proposes to remove." 

Knowing that we are responsible -- "response-able" - is fundamental to effectiveness and to every 
other habit of effectiveness we will discuss. 

Application Suggestions 

1. For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How 
often do you use and hear reactive phrases such as "If only," "I can't," or "I have to" 

2. Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, 
you would probably behave reactively. Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence. 
How could you respond proactively? Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your 
mind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between 
sti mul us and response. M ake a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose. 

3. Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether 
it is a direct, indirect, or no control problem. Identify the first step you can take in your Circle of 
I nfl uence to solve it and then take that step. 

4. Try the 30-day test of proactivity. Be aware of the change in your Circleof Influence.

Habit 2: Begin with the End in M ind TM 


What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us 

- Oliver Wendell Holme 

* 

Please find a place to read these next few pages where you can be alone and uninterrupted. Clear 
your mind of everything except what you will read and what I will invite you to do. Don't worry 
about your schedule, your business, your family, or your friends. Just focus with me and really open 
your mind. 

In your mind's eye, see yourself going to the funeral parlor or chapel, parking the car, and getting 
out. As you walk insidethe building, you notice the flowers, the soft organ music. You see the faces 
of friends and family you pass along the way. You feel the shared sorrow of losing, the joy of having 
known, that radiates from the hearts of the people there. 

As you walk down to the front of the room and look inside the casket, you suddenly come face to 
face with yourself. This is your funeral, three years from today. All these people have come to honor 
you, to express feelings of love and appreciation for your life. 

As you take a seat and wait for the services to begin, you look at the program in your hand. There 
are to be four speakers. The first one is from your family, immediate and also extended -- children, 
brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all 
over the country to attend. The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense 
of what you were as a person. The third speaker is from your work or profession. And the fourth is 
from your church or some community organization where you've been involved in service. 

Now think deeply. What would you like each of these speakers to say about you and your life? 
What kind of husband, wife, father, or mother would you like their words to reflect? What kind of son 
or daughter or cousin? What kind of friend? What kind of working associate? 

What character would you like them to have seen in you? What contributions, what achievements 
would you want them to remember? Look carefully at the peoplearound you. What difference would 
you like to have made in their lives? 

Before you read further, take a few minutes to jot down your impressions. It will greatly increase 
your personal understanding of Habit 2. 

What it Means to "Begin with the End in Mind"

Consider the words of Joseph Addison: 

When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the 
epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a 
tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider 
the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: when I see kings lying by those who 
deposed them, I consider rival wits placed side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with 
their contests and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions, factions, 
and debates of mankind. When I read the several dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and 
some six hundred years ago, I consider that great Day when we shall all of us be Contemporaries, and 
make our appearance together. 

Although Habit 2 applies to many different circumstances and levels of life, the most fundamental

Brarjt, to you tyHyHsnt 


application of "Begin with the End in Mind" is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of 
the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. 
Each part of your life -- today's behavior, tomorrow's behavior, next week's behavior, next month's 
behavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you. By 
keeping that end clearly in mind, you can make certain that whatever you do on any particular day 
does not violate the criteria you have defined as supremely important, and that each day of your life 
contributes in a meaningful way to the vision you have of your life as a whole. 

To Begin with the End in M ind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It 
means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the 
steps you take are always in the right direction. 

It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and 
harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall. It is 
possible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective. 

People often find themselves achieving victories that are empty, successes that have come at the 
expense of things they suddenly realize were far more valuable to them. People from every walk of 
life-- doctors, academicians, actors, politicians, business professionals, athletes, and plumbers-- often 
struggle to achieve a higher income, more recognition or a certain degree of professional competence, 
only to find that their drive to achieve their goal blinded them to the things that really mattered most 
and now are gone. 

How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that 
picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most. If the ladder 
is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster. We may 
be very busy, we may be very efficient, but we will also be truly effective only when we Begin with the 
End in Mind. 

If you carefully consider what you wanted to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find 
your definition of success. It may be very different from the definition you thought you had in mind. 
Perhaps fame, achievement, money, or some of the other things we strive for are not even part of the 
right wall. 

When you Begin with the End in M ind, you gain a different perspective. One man asked another 
on thedeath of a mutual friend, "How much did he leave?" Hisfriend responded, "He left it all." 

All Things AreCreated Twice 

"Begin with the End in Mind" is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's a 
mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation to all things 

Take the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer 
thefirstnail intoplace. You try to get a very clear sense of what kind of house you want. Ifyouwant 
a family-centered home, you plan a family room where it would be a natural gathering place. You 
plan sliding doors and a patio for children to play outside. You work with ideas. You work with 
your mind until you getaclear image of what you want to build. 

Then you reduce it to blueprint and develop construction plans. All of this is done before the earth 
is touched. If not, then in the second creation, the physical creation, you will have to make expensive 
changes that may double the cost of your home. 

The carpenter's rule is "measure twice, cut once." You have to make sure that the blueprint, the first 
creation, is really what you want, that you've thought everything through. Then you put it into bricks 
and mortar. Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching 
orders for the day. You Begin with the End in M ind. 

For another example, look at a business. If you want to have a successful enterprise, you clearly 
















THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


define what you're trying to accomplish. You carefully think through the product or service you want 
to provide in terms of your market target, then you organize all the elements -- financial, research and 
development, operations, marketing, personnel, physical facilities, and so on -- to meet that objective. 
The extent to which you Begin with the End in Mind often determines whether or not you are able to 
create a successful enterprise. Most business failures begin in the first creation, with problems such as 
undercapitalization, misunderstanding of the market, or lack of a business plan. 

The same is true with parenting. If you want to raise responsible, self-disciplined children, you 
have to keep that end clearly in mind as you interact with your children on a daily basis. You can't 
behavetoward them in ways that undermine their self-discipline or self-esteem. 

To varying degrees, people use this principle in many different areas of life. Before you go on a 
trip, you determine your destination and plan out the best route. Before you plant a garden, you plan 
it out in your mind, possibly on paper. You create speeches on paper before you give them, you 
envision the landscaping in your yard before you landscape it, you design the clothes you make before 
you thread the needle. 

To the extent to which we understand the principle of two creations and accept the responsi bil ity for 
both, we act within and enlarge the borders of our Circle of Influence. To the extent to which we do 
not operate in harmony with this principleand take charge of the fi rst creation, wediminish it. 

By Design or Default 

It's a princi pie that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design. In 
our personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first 
creations, we empower other people and circumstances outside our Circle or Influence to shape much 
of our lives by default. We reactively live the scripts handed to us by family, associates, other people's 
agendas, the pressures of circumstance -- scripts from our earlier years, from our training, our 
conditioning 

These scripts come from people, not principles. And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our 
deep dependency on others and our need for acceptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of 
i mportance and worth, for a feel i ng that we matter. 

Whether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in control of it or not, there is a first creation to 
every part of our lives. We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the 
second creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits 

The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine 
first creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own 
script. Put another way, Habit Isays, "You are the creator." Habit 2 is thefi rst creation. 

Leadership and Management-The Two Creations 

Habit 2 is based on principles of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first 
creation. Leadership is not management. Management is the second creation, which well discuss in 
the chapter on Habit 3. But leadership has to come first. 

Management is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals 
with the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and 
Warren Bennis, "Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things)' Management 
is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning 
against the right wall. 

You can quickly grasp the important difference between the two if you envision a group of 
producers cutting their way through the jungle with machetes. They're the producers, the problem 








THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


solvers. They're cutting through the undergrowth, clearing it out. 

The managers are behind them, sharpening their machetes, writing policy and procedure manuals, 
holding muscle development programs, bringing in improved technologies, and setting up working 
schedules and compensation programs for machete wielders. 

The leader is the one who climbs the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells, "Wrong 
jungle!" 

But how do the busy, efficient producers and managers often respond? "Shut up! We're making 
progress." 

As individuals, groups, and businesses, we're often so busy cutting through the undergrowth we 
don't even realize we're in the wrong jungle. And the rapidly changing environment in which we live 
makes effective leadership more critical than it has ever been -- in every aspect of independent and 
interdependent life. 

We are more in need of a vision or designation and a compass (a set of principles or directions) and 
less in need of a road map. We often don't know what the terrain ahead will be like or what we will 
need to go through it; much will depend on our judgment at the time. But an inner compass will 
always give us direction. 

Effectiveness -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on 
whether or not the effort we expend is in the right jungle. And the metamorphosis taking place in 
most every industry and profession demands leadership first and management second. 

In business, the market is changing so rapidly that many products and services that successfully met 
consumer tastes and needs a few years ago are obsolete today. Proactive powerful leadership must 
constantly monitor environmental change, particularly customer buying habits and motives, and 
provide the force necessary to organize resources in the right direction. 

Such changes as deregulation of the airline industry, skyrocketing costs of health care, and the great 
quality and quantity of imported cars impact the environment in significant ways. If industries do not 
monitor the environment, including their own work teams, and exercise the creative leadership to keep 
headed in the right direction, no amount of management expertise can keep them from failing. 

Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual phrased it, "like 
straightening deck chairs on the Titanic." No management success can compensate for failure in 
leadership. But leadership is hard because we're often caught in a management paradigm. 

Atthefinal session of a year-long executive development program in Seattle, the president of an oil 
company came up to me and said, "Stephen, when you pointed out the difference between leadership 
and management in the second month, I looked at my role as the president of this company and 
realized that I had never been into leadership. I was deep into management, buried by pressing 
challenges and the details of day-to-day logistics. So I decided to withdraw from management. I 
could get other peopleto do that. I wanted to really lead my organization. 

"It was hard. I went through withdrawal pains because I stopped dealing with a lot of the pressing, 
urgent matters that were right in front of me and which gave me a sense of immediate accomplishment. 

I didn't receive much satisfaction as I started wrestling with the direction issues, the culture-building 
issues, the deep analysis of problems, the seizing of new opportunities. Others also went through 
withdrawal pains from their working style comfort zones. They missed the easy accessibility I had 
given them before. They still wanted me to be available to them, to respond, to help solve their 
problems on a day-to-day basis. 

"But I persisted. I was absolutely convinced that I needed to provide leadership. And I did. 
Today our whole business is different. We're more in line with our environment. We have doubled 
our revenues and quadrupled our profits. I'm into leadership." 

I'm convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of 
control, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling.

And leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives. We're into managing with efficiency, 
setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. 

Rescripting: Becoming Your Own First Creator 

As we previously observed, proactivity is based on the unique human endowment of self-awareness. 
The two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our proactivity and to exercise 
personal leadership in our lives are imagination and conscience. 

Through imagination, we can visualize the uncreated worlds of potential that lie within us. 
Through conscience, we can come in contact with universal laws or principles with our own singular 
talents and avenues of contribution, and with the personal guidelines within which we can most 
effectively develop them. Combined with self-awareness, these two endowments empower usto write 
our own script. 

Because we already live with many scripts that have been handed to us, the process of writing our 
own script is actually more a process of "rescripting," or Paradigm Shifting -- of changing some of the 
basic paradigms that we already have. As we recognize the ineffective scripts, the incorrect or 
incomplete paradigms within us, wecan proactively begin to rescript ourselves. 

I think one of the most inspiring accounts of the rescripting process comes from the autobiography 
of Anwar Sadat, past president of Egypt. Sadat had been reared, nurtured, and deeply scripted in a 
hatred for Israel. Hewould make the statement on national television, "I will never shakethehand of 
an Israeli as long as they occupy one inch of Arab soil. Never, never, never!" And huge crowds all 
around the country would chant, "Never, never, never!" He marshaled the energy and unified the will 
of the whole country i n that scri pt. 

The script was very independent and nationalistic, and it aroused deep emotions in the people. But 
it was also very foolish, and Sadat knew it. It ignored the perilous, highly interdependent reality of the 
situation. 

So he rescripted himself. It was a process he had learned when he was a young man imprisoned in 
Cell 54, a solitary cell in Cairo Central Prison, as a result of his involvement in a conspiracy plot against 
King Farouk. He learned to withdraw from his own mind and look at it to see if the scripts were 
appropriate and wise. He learned how to vacate his own mind and, through a deep personal process 
of meditation, to work with his own scriptures, his own form of prayer, and rescript himself. 

He records that he was almost loath to leave his prison cell because it was there that he realized that 
real success is success with self. It's not in having things, but in having mastery, having victory over 
self. 

For a period of time during Nasser's administration Sadat was relegated to a position of relative 
insignificance. Everyone felt that his spirit was broken, but it wasn't. They were projecting their own 
home movies onto him. They didn't understand him. Hewas biding histime. 

And when that time came, when he became president of Egypt and confronted the political realities, 
he rescripted himself toward Israel. He visited the Knesset in Jerusalem and opened up one of the 
most precedent-breaking peace movements in the history of the world, a bold initiative that eventually 
brought about the Camp David Accord. 

Sadat was able to use his self-awareness, his imagination, and his conscience to exercise personal 
leadership, to change an essential paradigm, to change the way he saw the situation. He worked in the 
center of his Circle of Influence. And from that rescripting, that change in paradigm, flowed changes 
in behavior and attitude that affected millions of lives in the wider Circleof Concern. 

In developing our own self-awareness many of us discover ineffective scripts, deeply embedded 
habits that are totally unworthy of us, totally incongruent with the things we really value in life. Habit 
2 says we don't have to live with those scripts. We are response-able to use our imagination and 








THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


creativity to write new ones that are more effective, more congruent with our deepest values and with 
the correct pri nci pies that gi ve ou r val ues meani ng. 

Suppose, for example, that I am highly overreactive to my children. Suppose that whenever they 
begin to do something I feel is inappropriate, I sense an immediate tensing in the pit of my stomach. I 
feel defensive walls go up; I prepare for battle. My focus is not on the long-term growth and 
understanding but on the short-term behavior. I'm trying to win the battle, notthewar. 

I pull out my ammunition -- my superior size, my position of authority-- and I yell or inti mi date or I 
threaten or punish. And I win. I stand there, victorious, in the middle of the debris of a shattered 
relationship while my children are outwardly submissive and inwardly rebellious, suppressing feelings 
that will come out later in uglier ways. 

Now if I were sitting at that funeral we visualized earlier, and one of my children was about to 
speak, I would want his life to represent the victory of teaching, training, and disciplining with love 
over a period of years rather than the battle scars of quick-fix skirmishes. I would want his heart and 
mind to be filled with the pleasant memories of deep, meaningful ti mes together. I would want him to 
remember me as a loving father who shared the fun and the pain of growing up. I would want him to 
remember the times he came to me with his problems and concerns. I would want to have listened 
and loved and helped. I would want him to know I wasn't perfect, but that I had tried with everything 
I had. And that, perhaps morethan anybody in the world, I loved him. 

The reason I would want those things is because, deep down, I value my children. I love them, I 
want to help them. I value my role as their father. 

But I don't always see those values. I get caught up in the "thick of thin things}" What matters most 
gets buried under layers of pressing problems, immediate concerns, and outward behaviors. I become 
reactive. And the way I interact with my children every day often bears little resemblance to the way I 
deeply feel about them. 

Because I am self-aware, because I have imagination and conscience, I can examine my deepest 
values. I can realize that the script I'm living is not in harmony with those values, that my life is not 
the product of my own proactive design, but the result of the first creation I have deferred to 
circumstances and other people. And I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my 
memory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past. I can become my own 
fi rst creator. 

To Begin with the End in M ind means to approach my role as a parent, as well as my other roles in 
life, with my values and directions clear. It means to be responsible for my own first creation, to 
rescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitudeflow are congruent with my 
deepest val ues and in harmony with correct principles. 

It also means to begin each day with those values firmly in mind. Then as the vicissitudes, as the 
challenges come, I can make my decisions based on those values. I can act with integrity. I don't 
have to react to the emotion, the circumstance. I can be truly proactive, value driven, because my 
val ues are clear. 

A Personal M ission Statement 

The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission 
statement or philosophy or creed. It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do 
(contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are 
based 

Because each individual is unique, a personal mission statement will reflect that uniqueness, both in 
content and form. My friend, Rolfe Kerr, has expressed his personal creed in this way: 

Succeed at home first. 












THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


Seek and merit divine help. 

Never compromise with honesty. 

Remember the people involved. 

Hear both sides before judging. 

Obtain counsel of others. 

Defend those who are absent. 

Be si ncere yet deci si ve. 

Develop one new proficiency a year. 

Plan tomorrow's work today. 

Hustle while you wait. 

Maintain a positive attitude. 

Keep a sense of humor. 

Be orderly in person and in work. 

Do not fear mistakes -- fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to 
those mistakes. 

Faci I itate the success of su bord i nates. 

Listen twice as much as you speak. 

Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or 
promotion. 

A woman seeking to balance family and work values has expressed her sense of personal mission 
differently: 

I will seek to balance career and family as best I can si nee both are i mportant to me. 

My home will be a place where I and my family, friends, and guests find joy, comfort, peace, and 
happiness. Still I will seek to create a clean and orderly environment, yet livable and comfortable. I 
will exercise wisdom in what we choose to eat, read, see, and do at home. I especially want to teach 
my children to love, to learn, and to laugh -- and to work and develop their uniquetalents. 

I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society. I will be a concerned 
and informed citizen, involved in the political process to ensure my voice is heard and my vote is 
counted. 

I will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life's goals. I will 
act on situations and opportunities, rather than to beaded upon. 

I will always try to keep myself free from addidive and destrudive habits. I will develop habits 
that free me from old labelsand limits and expand my capabilities and choices. 

My money will be my servant, not my master. I will seek financial independence over time. My 
wants will besubjedto my needs and my means. Except for long-term home and car loans, I will seek 
to keep myself free from consumer debt. I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part 
of my i ncome. 

Moreover, I will use what money and talents I have to make life more enjoyable for others through 
service and charitable giving. 

You could call a personal mission statement a personal constitution. Like the United States 
Constitution, it's fundamentally changeless. In over 200 years, there have been only 26 amendments, 
10 of which were in the original Bill of Rights. 

The United States Constitution is the standard by which every law in the country is evaluated. It is 
the document the president agrees to defend and support when he takes the Oath of Allegiance. It is 
the criterion by which people are admitted into citizenship. It is the foundation and the center that 
enables people to ride through such major traumas as the Civil War, Vietnam, or Watergate. It is the 
written standard, the key criterion by which everything else is evaluated and directed. 

The Constitution has endured and serves its vital function today because it is based on correct 




THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


principles, on the self-evident truths contained in the Declaration of Independence. These principles 
empower the Constitution with a timeless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change. 
"Our peculiar security," said Thomas Jefferson, "is in the possession of a written Constitution." 

A personal mission statement based on correct principles becomes the same kind of standard for an 
individual. It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the 
basisfor making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and emotions that affect our lives. It 
empowers individuals with the same timeless strength in the midst of change. 

Peoplecan't live with change if there's not a changeless core inside them. The key to the ability to 
change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value. 

With a mission statement, we can flow with changes. We don't need prejudgments or prejudices. 
We don't need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and 
everybody in order to accommodate reality 

Our personal environment is also changing at an ever-increasing pace. Such rapid change burns 
out a large number of people who feel they can hardly handle it, can hardly cope with life. They 
become reactive and essentially give up, hoping that the things that happen to them will be good. 

But it doesn't have to be that way. In the Nazi death camps where Viktor Frankl learned the 
principle of proactivity, he also learned the importance of purpose, of meaning in life. The essence of 
"logotherapy," the philosophy he later developed and taught, is that many so-called mental and 
emotional illnesses are really symptoms of an underlying sense of meaninglessness or emptiness. 
Logotherapy eliminates that emptiness by helping the individual to detect his unique meaning, his 
mission in life. 

Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity. You have the 
vision and the values which direct your life. You have the basic direction from which you set your 
long- and short-term goals. You have the power of a written constitution based on correct principles, 
against which every decision concerning the most effective use of your time, your talents, and your 
energies can be effectively measured. 

At the Center 

In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of 
Influence, that center comprised of our most basic Our paradigms, the lens through which we seethe 
world. 

It is here that we deal with our vision and our values. It is here that we use our endowment of 
self-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps 
accurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles and reality. It is here that 
we use our endowment of conscience as a compass to help us detect our own unique talents and areas 
of contribution. It is here that we use our endowment of imagination to mentally create the end we 
desire, giving direction and purpose to our beginnings and providing the substance of a written 
personal constitution. 

It is also here that our focused efforts achieve the greatest results. As we work within the very 
center of our Circle of Influence, we expand it. This is highest-leverage PC work, significantly 
i mpacti ng the effectiveness of every aspect of our I ives. 

Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. 

Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, 
your basic personal strength or lack of it. 

Guidance means your source of direction in life. Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of 
reference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit 
criteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing.

Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various 
parts and principles apply and relate to each other. It embraces judgment, discernment, 
comprehension. It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness. 

Power is the faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accompl ish something. It is the 
vital energy to make choices and decisions. It also includes the capacity to overcome deeply 
embedded habits and to cultivate higher, more effective ones. 

These four factors -- security, guidance, wisdom, and power -- are interdependent. Security and 
clear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom becomes the spark or catalyst to release and direct 
power. When these four factors are present together, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they 
create the great force of a noble personality, a balanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. 

These life-support factors also undergird every other dimension of life. And none of them is an 
all-or-nothing matter. The degree to which you havedeveloped each one could be charted somewhere 
on a continuum, much like the Maturity Continuum described earlier. At the bottom end, the four 
factors are weak. You are basically dependent on circumstances or other people, things over which 
you have no direct control. At the top end you are in control. You have independent strength and 
the foundation for rich, interdependent relationships. 

Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity on one end, wherein 
your life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that play upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth 
and personal security on the other end. Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on 
the social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inner direction. Your wisdom falls 
somewhere between a totally inaccurate map where everything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, 
and a complete and accurate map of life wherein all the parts and principles are properly related to each 
other. Your power lies somewhere between immobilization or being a puppet pulled by someone 
else's strings to high proactivity, the power to act according to your own values instead of being acted 
upon by other people and circumstances. 

The location of these factors on the continuum, the resulting degree of their integration, harmony, 
and balance, and their positive impact on every aspect of your life is a function of your center, the basic 
paradigms at your very core. 

A Iternati ve C enters 

Each of us has a center, though we usually don't recognize it as such. Neither do we recognize the 
all-encompassing effects of that center on every aspect of our lives. 

Let's briefly examine several centers or core paradigms people typically have for a better 
understanding of how they affect these four fundamental dimensions and, ultimately, the sum of life 
that flows from them. 

Spouse Centeredness. M arriage can be the most intimate, the most satisfying, the most enduring, 
growth-producing of human relationships. It might seem natural and proper to be centered on one's 
husband or wife. 

But experience and observation tell a different story. Over the years, I have been involved in 
working with many troubled marriages, and I have observed a certain thread weaving itself through 
almost every spouse-centered relationship I have encountered. That thread is strong emotional 
dependence. 

If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly 
dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and 
treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship -- a new child, 
in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth. 

When responsibilities increase and stresses come i n the marriage, wetend to revert to the scripts we 






THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsnt 


were given as we were growing up. But so does our spouse. And those scripts are usually different. 
Different ways of handling financial, child-discipline, or in-law issues come to the surface. When these 
deep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered 
relationship reveal sal I its vulnerability. 

When we are dependent on the person with whom we are in conflict, both need and conflict are 
compounded. Love-hate overreactions, fight-or-flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, 
bitterness, resentment, and cold competition are some of the usual results. When these occur, we tend 
to fall even further back on background tendencies and habits in an effort to justify and defend our own 
behavior and we attack our spouse's. 

Inevitably, anytime we are too vulnerable we feel the need to protect ourselves from further wounds. 
So we resort to sarcasm, cutting humor, criticism -- anything that will keep from exposing the 
tenderness within. Each partner tends to wait on the initiative of the other for love, only to be 
di sappoi nted but al so conf i rmed as to the ri ghtness of the accusati ons made. 

There is only phantom security in such a relationship when all appears to be going well. Guidance 
is based on the emotion of the moment. Wisdom and power are lost in the counterdependent negative 
interactions. 

Family Centeredness. Another common center is the family. This, too, may seem to be natural 
and proper. As an area of focus and deep investment, it provides great opportunities for deep 
relationships, for loving, for sharing, for much that makes life worthwhile. But as a center, it ironically 
destroys the very elements necessary to family success. 

People who are family-centered get their sense of security or personal worth from the family 
tradition and culture or the family reputation. Thus, they become vulnerable to any changes in that 
tradition or culture and to any influences that would affect that reputation. 

Family-centered parents do not have the emotional freedom, the power, to raise their children with 
their ultimate welfare truly in mind. If they derive their own security from the family, their need to be 
popular with their children may override the importance of a long-term investment in their children's 
growth and development. Or they may be focused on the proper and correct behavior of the moment. 
Any behavior that they consider improper threatens their security. They become upset, guided by the 
emotions of the moment, spontaneously reacting to the immediate concern rather than the long-term 
growth and development of the chi Id. They may overreact and punish out of bad temper. They tend 
to love their children conditionally, making them emotionally dependent or counterdependent and 
rebellious. 

Money Centeredness. Another logical and extremely common center to people's lives is making 
money. Economic security is basic to one's opportunity to do much in any other dimension. In a 
hierarchy or continuum of needs, physical survival and financial security comes first. Other needs are 
not even activated until that basic need is satisfied, at least minimally. 

Most of us face economic worries. Many forces in the wider culture can and do act upon our 
economic situation, causing or threatening such disruption that we often experience concern and worry 
that may not always rise to the conscious surface. 

Sometimes there are apparently noble reasons given for making money, such as the desire to take 
care of one's family. And these things are important. Buttofocuson money-making as a center will 
bring about its own undoing. 

Consider again the four life-support factors -- security, guidance, wisdom, and power. Suppose I 
derive much of my security from my employment or from my income or net worth. Since many 
factors affect these economic foundations, I become anxious and uneasy, protective and defensive, 
about anything that may affect them. When my sense of personal worth comes from my net worth, I 
am vulnerable to anything that will affect that net worth. But work and money, per se, provide no 
wisdom, no guidance, and only a limited degree of power and security. All it takes to show the

limitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. 

Money-centered people often put aside family or other priorities, assuming everyone will 
understand that economic demands come first. I know one father who was leaving with his children 
for a promised trip to the circus when a phone cal I came for him to come to work instead. He declined. 
When his wife suggested that perhaps he should have gone to work, he responded, 'The work will 
come again, but childhood won't." For the rest of their lives his children remembered this little act of 
priority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts. 

Work Centered ness. Work-centered people may become "workaholics," driving themselves to 
produce at the sacrifice of health, relationships, and other important areas of their lives. Their 
fundamental identity comes from their work -- "I'm a doctor," "I'm a writer," "I'm an actor." 

Because their identity and sense of self-worth are wrapped up in their work, their security is 
vulnerable to anything that happens to prevent them from continuing in it. Their guidance is a 
function of the demands of the work. Their wisdom and power come in the limited areas of their work, 
rendering them ineffective in other areas of life. 

Possession Centeredness. A driving force of many people is possessions - not only tangible, 
material possessions such as fashionable clothes, homes, cars, boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible 
possessions of fame, glory, or social prominence. Most of us are aware, through our own experience, 
how singularly flawed such a center is, simply because it can vanish rapidly and it is influenced by so 
many forces. 

If my sense of security lies in my reputation or in the things I have, my life will be in a constant state 
of threat and jeopardy that these possessions may be lost or stolen or devalued. If I'm in the presence 
of someone of greater net worth or fame or status, I feel inferior. If I'm in the presence of someone of 
lesser net worth or fame or status, I feel superior. My sense of self-worth constantly fluctuates. I 
don't have any sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent selfhood. I am constantly trying to 
protect and insure my assets, properties, securities, position, or reputation. We have all heard stories 
of people committing suicide after losing their fortunes in a significant stock decline or their fame in a 
political reversal. 

Pleasure Centeredness. Another common center, closely allied with possessions, is that of fun and 
pleasure. We live in a world where instant gratification is available and encouraged. Television and 
movies are major influences in increasing people's expectations. They graphically portray what other 
peoplehaveand can do in living the life of ease and "fun." 

But while the glitter of pleasure-centered lifestyles is graphically portrayed, the natural result of 
such lifestyles -- the impact on the inner person, on productivity, on relationships -- is seldom 
accurately seen. 

Innocent pleasures in moderation can provide relaxation for the body and mind and can foster 
family and other relationships. But pleasure, per se, offers no deep, lasting satisfaction or sense of 
fulfillment. The pleasure-centered person, too soon bored with each succeeding level of "fun," 
constantly cries for more and more. So the next new pleasure has to be bigger and better, more 
exciting, with a bigger "high." A person in this state becomes almost entirely narcissistic, interpreting all 
of life in terms of the pleasure it provides to the self here and now. 

Too many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game 
playing -- too much undisciplined leisure time in which a person continually takes the course of least 
resistance -- gradually wastes a life. It ensures that a person's capacities stay dormant, that talents 
remain undeveloped, that the mind and spirit become lethargic and that the heart is unfulfilled. 
Where is the security, the guidance, the wisdom, and the power? At the low end of the continuum, in 
the pleasure of a fleeting moment. 

Malcom Muggeridge writes "A Twentieth-Century Testimony": 

When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about 






THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


it is that what seemed at the time most significant and seductive, seems now most futile and absurd. 
For instance, success in all of its various guises; being known and being praised; ostensible pleasures, 
like acquiring money or seducing women, or traveling, going to and fro in the world and up and down 
in it I ike Satan, explaining and experiencing whatever Vanity Fair has to offer. 

In retrospect, all these exercises in self-gratification seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called, "licking 
the earth." 

Friend/ Enemy Centeredness. Young people are particularly, though certainly not exclusively, 
susceptible to becoming friend-centered. Acceptance and belonging to a peer group can become 
almost supremely important. The distorted and ever-changing social mirror becomes the source for 
the four life-support factors, creating a high degree of dependence on the fluctuating moods, feelings, 
attitudes, and behavior of others. 

Friend centeredness can also focus exclusively on one person, taking on some of the dimensions of 
marriage. The emotional dependence on one individual, the escalating need/ conflict spiral, and the 
resulting negative interactions can grow out of friend centeredness. 

And what about putting an enemy at the center of one's life? Most people would never think of it, 
and probably no one would ever do it consciously. Nevertheless, enemy centering is very common, 
particularly when there is frequent interaction between people who are in real conflict. When 
someone feels he has been unjustly dealt with by an emotionally or socially significant person, it is very 
easy for him to become preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of his life. 
Rather than proactively leading his own life, the enemy-centered person is counterdependently reacting 
to the behavior and attitudes of a perceived enemy. 

One friend of mine who taught at a university became very distraught because of the weaknesses of 
a particular administrator with whom he had a negative relationship. Fie allowed himself to think 
about the man constantly until eventually it became an obsession. It so preoccupied him that it 
affected the quality of his relationships with his family, his church, and his working associates. Fie 
finally came to the conclusion that he had to leave the university and accept a teaching appointment 
somewhere else. 

"Wouldn't you really prefer to teach at this university, if the man were not here?" I asked him. 

"Yes, I would," he responded. "But as long as he is here, then my staying is too disruptive to 
everything in life. I have to go. 

"Why have you madethis administrator the center of your life?" I asked him. 

Fie was shocked by the question. Fledeniedit. But I pointed outto him that he was allowing one 
individual and his weaknesses to distort his entire map of life, to undermine his faith and the quality of 
his relationships with his loved ones. 

Fie finally admitted that this individual had had such an impact on him, but he denied that he 
himself had made all these choices. FIe attributed the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the 
administrator. Fie, himself, he declared, was not responsible. 

As we talked, little by little, he came to realize that he was indeed responsible, but that because he 
did not handlethis responsibility well, hewas being irresponsible. 

Many divorced peoplefall into a similar pattern. Theyarestill consumed with anger and bitterness 
and self-justification regarding an ex-spouse. In a negative sense, psychologically they are still 
married -- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations. 

Many "older" children go through life either secretly or openly hating their parents. They blame 
them for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they center their adult life on that hatred, living out the 
reactive, justifying script that accompanies it. 

The individual who is friend- or enemy-centered has no intrinsic security. Feelings of self-worth 
are volatile, a function of the emotional state or behavior of other people. Guidance comes from the 
person's perception of how others will respond, and wisdom is limited by the social lens or by an 






THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


enemy-centered paranoia. The individual has no power. Other people are pulling the strings. 

Church Centeredness. I believe that almost anyone who is seriously involved in any church will 
recognize that churchgoing is not synonymous with personal spirituality. There are some people who 
get so busy in church worship and projects that they become insensitive to the pressing human needs 
that surround them, contradicting the very precepts they profess to believe deeply. There are others 
who attend church less frequently or not at all but whose attitudes and behavior reflect a more genuine 
centering in the principles of the basicJudeo-Christian ethic. 

Having participated throughout my life in organized church and community service groups, I have 
found that attending church does not necessarily mean living the principles taught in those meetings. 
You can be active in a church but inactive in its gospel. 

In the church-centered life, image or appearance can become a person's dominant consideration, 
leading to hypocrisy that undermines personal security and intrinsic worth. Guidance comes from a 
social conscience, and the church-centered person tends to label others artificially in terms of "active," 
"inactive," "liberal," "orthodox," or "conservative." 

Because the church is a formal organization made up of policies, programs, practices, and people, it 
cannot by itself give a person any deep, permanent security or sense of intrinsic worth. Living the 
principles taught by the church can do this, but the organization alone cannot. 

N or can the church give a person a constant sense of guidance. Church-centered people often tend 
to live in compartments, acting and thinking and feeling in certain ways on the Sabbath and in totally 
different ways on weekdays. Such a lack of wholeness or unity or integrity is a further threat to 
security, creating the need for increased labeling and self-justifying. 

Seeing the church as an end rather than as a means to an end undermines a person's wisdom and 
sense of balance. Although the church claims to teach people about the source of power, it does not 
claim to be that power itself. It claims to be one vehicle through which divine power can be channeled 
into man's nature. 

Self-Centered ness. Perhaps the most common center today is the self. The most obvious form is 
selfishness, which violates the values of most people. But if we look closely at many of the popular 
approaches to growth and self-fulfillment, weoften find self-centering at their core. 

There is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power in the limited center of self. Like the Dead Sea 
in Palestine, it accepts but never gives. It becomes stagnant. 

On the other hand, paying attention to the development of self in the greater perspective of 
improving one's ability to serve, to produce, to contribute in meaningful ways, gives context for 
dramatic increase in the four life-support factors 

These are some of the more common centers from which people approach life. It is often much 
easier to recognize the center in someone else's life than to see it in your own. You probably know 
someone who puts making money ahead of everything else. You probably know someone whose 
energy isdevoted to justifying hisor her position in an ongoing negative relationship. If you look, you 
can sometimes see beyond behavior into the center that creates it. 


I denti fy i ng You r C enter 


But where do you stand? What is at the center of your own I ife? Sometimes that isn't easy to see 
Perhaps the best way to identify your own center is to look closely at your life-support factors. If 
you can identify with one or more of the descriptions below, you can trace it back to the center from 
which itflows, a center which may be limiting your personal effectiveness.

More often than not, a person's center is some combination of these and/ or other centers. Most 
people are very much a function of a variety of influences that play upon their lives. Depending on 
external or internal conditions, one particular center may be activated until the underlying needs are 
satisfied. Then another center becomes the compel I ing force. 

As a person fluctuates from one center to another, the resulting relativism is like roller coasting 
through life. One moment you're high, the next moment you're low, making efforts to compensate for 
one weakness by borrowing strength from another weakness. There is no consistent sense of direction, 
no persistent wisdom, no steady power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity. 

The ideal, of course, is to create one cl ear center from which you consistently derive a high degree of 
security, guidance, wisdom, and power, empowering your proactivity and giving congruency and 
harmony to every part of your life. 

A Principle Center 

By centering our lives on correct principles, we create a sol id foundation for development of the four 
life-support factors 

Our security comes from knowing that, unlike other centers based on people or things which are 
subject to frequent and immediate change, correct principles do not change. We can depend on them 




















THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyFltfHsirt 


Principles don't react to anything. They won't divorce us or run away with our best friend. They 
aren't out to get us. They can't pave our way with shortcuts and quick fixes. They don't depend on 
the behavior of others, the environment, or the current fad for their validity. Principles don't die. 
They aren't here one day and gone the next. They can't be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. 

Principles are deep, fundamental truths, classic truths, generic common denominators. They are 
tightly interwoven threads running with exactness, consistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric 
of life. 

Even in the midst of people or circumstances that seem to ignore the principles, we can be secure in 
the knowledge that principles are bigger than people or circumstances, and that thousands of years of 
history have seen them triumph, time and time again. Even more important, we can be secure in the 
knowledge that wecan validate them in our own lives, by our own experience. 

Admittedly, we're not omniscient. Our knowledge and understanding of correct principles is 
limited by our own lack of awareness of our true nature and the world around us and by the flood of 
trendy philosophies and theories that are not in harmony with correct principles. These ideas will 
have their season of acceptance, but, like many before them, they won't endure because they're built on 
false foundations. 

We are limited, but we can push back the borders of our limitations. An understanding of the 
principle of our own growth enables us to search out correct principles with the confidence that the 
more we learn, the more clearly we can focus the lens through which we seethe world. The principles 
don't change; our understanding of them does. 

The wisdom and guidance that accompany Principle-Centered Living come from correct maps, from 
the way things really are, have been, and will be. Correct maps enable us to clearly see where we want 
to go and how to get there. We can make our decisions using the correct data that will make their 
implementation possibleand meaningful. 

The personal power that comes from Principle-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, 
knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or 
by many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people. 

The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are 
free to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose 
the consequences of those actions. Remember, "If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the 
other. 

Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences 
when we live in harmony with the principles. There are negative consequences when we ignore them. 
But because these principles apply to everyone, whether or not they are aware, this limitation is 
universal. And the more we know of correct principles, the greater is our personal freedom to act 
wisely. 

By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of 
effective living. It is the center that puts all other centers i n perspective. 

If you are Principle Centered... 

SECURITY 

Your security is based on correct principles that do not change, regardless of external conditions or 
ci rcumstances. 

You know that true principles can repeatedly be validated in your own life, through your own 
experiences. 

As a measurement of self-improvement, correct principles function with exactness, consistency, 
beauty and strength. 

Correct principles help you understand your own development, endowing you with the confidence 
to learn more, thereby increasing your knowledge and understanding.

Your source of security provides you with an immovable, unchanging, unfailing core enabling you 
to see change as an exciting adventure and opportunity to make significant contributions. 

GUIDANCE 

You are guided by a compass which enables you to see where you want to go and how you will get 
there. 

You use accurate data which makes your decisions both implementableand meaningful. 

You stand apart from life's situations, and circumstances and look at the balanced whole. Your 
decisions and actions reflect both short and long-term considerations and implications. 

In every situation, you consciously, proactively determine the best alternative, basing decisions on 
conscience educated by principles. 

WISDOM 

Your judgment encompasses a broad spectrum of long-term consequences and reflects a wise 
bal ance and qu i et assu ranee. 

You see things differently and thus you think and act differently from the largely reactive world. 

You view the world through a fundamental paradigm for effective, provident living. 

You seetheworld in terms of what you can dofortheworld and its people. 

You adopt a proactive lifestyle, seeking to serveand build others. 

You interpretail of life's experiences in terms of opportunities for learning and contribution. 

POWER 

Your power is limited only by your understanding and observance of natural law and correct 
principles and by the natural consequences of the principles themselves. 

You become a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, largely unrestricted by the attitudes, 
behaviors, or actions of others. 

Your ability to act reaches far beyond your own resources and encourages highly developed levels 
of interdependency. 

Your decisions and actions are not driven by your current financial or circumstantial limitations. 
You experience an interdependent freedom. 

Remember that your paradigm is the source from which your attitudes and behaviors flow. A 
paradigm is like a pair of glasses; it affects the way you see everything in your life. If you look at 
things through the paradigm of correct principles, what you see in life is dramatically different from 
what you see through any other centered paradigm. 

I have included in the Appendix section of this book a detailed chart which shows how each center 
we've discussed might possibly affect the way you see everything else. But for a quick understanding 
of the difference your center makes, let's look at just one example of a specific problem as seen through 
the different paradigms. As you read, try to put on each pair of glasses. Try to feel the response that 
flows from the different centers. 

Suppose tonight you have invited your wife to go to a concert. You have the tickets; she's excited 
about going. It's four o'clock in the afternoon. 

All of asudden, your boss calls you into his office and says he needs your help through the evening 
to get ready for an i important meeti ng at 9 A .M. tomorrow. 

If you're looking through spouse-centered or family-centered glasses, your main concern will be 
your wife. You may tell the boss you can't stay and you take her to the concert in an effort to please 
her. You may feel you have to stay to protect your job, but you'll do so grudgingly, anxious about her 
response, trying to justify your decision and protect yourself from her disappointment or anger. 

If you're looking through a money-centered lens, your main thought will be of the overtime you'll 
get or the influence working I ate will haveon apotential raise. You may call yourwifeand simplytell 
her you have to stay, assuming she'll understand that economic demands come first. 

If you're work-centered, you may bethinking of the opportunity. You can learn more about the job.

You can make some points with the boss and further your career. You may give yourself a pat on the 
back for putting hours well beyond what is required, evidence of what a hard worker you are. Your 
wife should be proud of you! 

If you're possession-centered, you might be thinking of the things the overtime income could buy. 
Or you might consider what an asset to your reputation at the office it would be if you stayed. 
Everyone would hear tomorrow how noble, how sacrificing and dedicated you are. 

If you're pleasure-centered, you'll probably can the work and go to the concert, even if your wife 
would be happy for you to work late. You deserve a night out! 

If you're friend-centered, your decision would be influenced by whether or not you had invited 
friends to attend the concert with you. Or whether your friends at work were going to stay late, too. 

If you're enemy-centered, you may stay late because you know it will give you a big edge over that 
person in the office who thinks he's the company's greatest asset. While he's off having fun, you'll be 
working and slaving, doing his work and yours, sacrificing your personal pleasure for the good of the 
company he can so blithely ignore. 

If you're church-centered, you might be influenced by plans other church members have to attend 
the concert, by whether or not any church members work at your office, or by the nature of the concert 
-- Handel's Messiah might rate higher in priority than a rock concert. Your decision might also be 
affected by what you think a "good church member" would do and by whether you view the extra work 
as "service" or "seeking after material wealth." 

If you're self-centered, you'll be focused on what will do you the most good. Would it be better for 
you to go out for the evening? Or would it be better for you to make a few points with the boss? How 
the different options affect you will be your main concern. 

As we consider various ways of looking at a single event, is it any wonder that we have "young 
lady/old lady" perception problems in our interactions with each other? Can you see how 
fundamentally our centers affect us? Right down to our motivations, our daily decisions, our actions (or, 
in too many cases, our reactions), our interpretations of events? That's why understanding your own 
center is so important. And if that center does not empower you as a proactive person, it becomes 
fundamental to your effectiveness to make the necessary Paradigm Shifts to create a center that will. 

As a principle-centered person, you try to stand apart from the emotion of the situation and from 
other factors that would act on you, and evaluate the option. Looking at the balanced whole -- the 
work needs, the family needs, other needs that may be involved and the possible implications of the 
various alternative decisions -- you'll try to come up with the best solution, taking all factors into 
consideration. 

Whether you go to the concert or stay and work is really a small part of an effective decision. You 
might make the same choice with a number of other centers. But there are several important 
differences when you are coming from a principle-centered paradigm. First, you are not being acted 
upon by other people or circumstances. You are proactively choosing what you determine to be the 
best alternative. You make your decisions consciously and knowledgeably. 

Second, you know your decision is most effective because it is based on principles with predictable 
long-term results. 

Third, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life. Staying at work to get the 
edge on someone at the office is an entirely different evening in your life from staying because you 
value your boss's effectiveness and you genuinely want to contribute to the company's welfare. The 
experiences you have as you carry out your decisions take on quality and meaning in the context of 
your life as a whole. 

Fourth, you can communicate to your wife and your boss within strong networks you've created in 
your interdependent relationships. Because you are independent, you can be effectively 
interdependent. You might decide to delegate what is delegable and come in early the next morning

to do the rest. 

And finally, you'll feel comfortable about your decision. Whatever you choose to do, you can focus 
on it and enjoy it. 

As a principle-centered person, you see things differently. And because you see things differently, 
you think differently, you act differently. Because you have a high degree of security, guidance, 
wisdom, and power that flows from a solid, unchanging core, you have the foundation of a highly 
proactive and highly effective life. 

Writing and Using a A Personal M ission Statement 

As we go deeply within ourselves, as we understand and realign our basic paradigms to bring them 
in harmony with correct principles, we create both an effective, empowering center and a clear lens 
through which we can seethe world. We can then focus that lens on how we, as unique individuals, 
relate to that world 

Frankl says we detect rather than invent our missions in life. I like that choice of words. I think 
each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience, that gives us an awareness of our own 
uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make. In Frankl's words, "Everyone has his 
own specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. 
Thus, everyone's task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. 

In seeking to give verbal expression to that uniqueness, we are again reminded of the fundamental 
importance of proactivity and of working within our Circle of Influence. To seek some abstract 
meaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our 
own first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people. 

Our meaning comes from within. Again, in the words of Frankl, "Ultimately, man should not ask 
what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each 
man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can 
only respond by being responsible." 

Personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fundamental to the first creation. Returning to the 
computer metaphor, H abit 1 says "You are the programmer." H abit 2, then, says, "Write the program." 
Until you accept the idea that you are responsible, that you are the programmer, you won't really invest 
in writing the program. 

As proactive people, we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives. 
We can write a personal mission statement, a personal constitution. 

A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful 
analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you 
several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete 
and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it 
regularly and make mi nor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. 

But fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your 
vision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything elsein your life. 

I recently finished reviewing my own mission statement, which I do fairly regularly. Sitting on the 
edge of a beach, alone, at the end of a bicycle ride, I took out my organizer and hammered it out. It 
took several hours, but I felt a sense of clarity, a sense of organization and commitment, a sense of 
exhilaration and freedom. 

I find the process isas important as the product. Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes 
you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior 
with your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you're not being driven by everything 
that happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you're trying to do and you are excited

about it. 

Using Your Whole Brain 

Our self-awareness empowers us to examine our own thoughts. This is particularly helpful in 
creating a personal mission statement because the two unique human endowments that enable us to 
practice Habit 2 -- imagination and conscience -- are primarily functions of the right side of the brain. 
Understanding how to tap into that right brain capacity greatly increases our first-creation ability. 

A great deal of research has been conducted for decades on what has come to be called brain 
dominance theory. The findings basically indicated that each hemisphere of the brain -- left and right 
-- tendsto specialize in and preside over different functions, process different kinds of information, and 
deal with different kinds of problems. 

Essentially, the left hemisphere is the more logical/ verbal one and the right hemisphere the more 
intuitive, creative one. The left deals with words, the right with pictures; the left with parts and 
specifics, the right with wholes and the relationship between the parts. The left deals with analysis, 
which means to break apart; the right with synthesis, which means to put together. The left deals with 
sequential thinking; the right with simultaneous and hoi istic thinki ng. Theleft isti me bound; the right 
isti me free. 

Although people use both sides of the brain, one side or the other generally tendsto be dominant in 
each individual. Of course, the ideal would be to cultivate and develop the ability to have good 
crossover between both sides of the brain so that a person could first sense what the situation called for 
and then use the appropriate tool to deal with it. But peopletend to stay in the "comfort zone" of their 
dominant hemisphere and process every situation according to either a right- or left-brain preference. 

In the words of Abraham Maslow, "He that is good with a hammer tends to think everything is a 
nail)" This is another factor that affects the "young lady/ old lady" perception difference. Right-brain 
and left-brain peopletend to look at things in different ways. 

We live in a primarily left-brain-dominant world, where words and measurement and logic are 
enthroned, and the more creative, intuitive, sensing, artistic aspect of our nature is often subordinated. 
Many of usfind it more difficult to tap into our right-brain capacity. 

Admittedly this description is oversimplified and new studies will undoubtedly throw more light 
on brain functioning. But the point here is that we are capable of performing many different kinds of 
thought processes and we barely tap our potential. As we become aware of its different capacities, we 
can consciously use our minds to meet specific needs in more effective ways. 

Two Ways to Tap the Right Brain 

If we use the brain dominance theory as a model, it becomes evident that the quality of our first 
creation is significantly impacted by our ability to use our creative right brain. The more we are able 
to draw upon our right-brain capacity, the more fully we will be able to visualize, to synthesize, to 
transcend time and present circumstances, to project a holistic picture of what we want to do and to be 
in life. 

Expand Perspective 

Sometimes weare knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought patterns and into the right 
brain by an unplanned experience. The death of a loved one, a severe illness, a financial setback, or 
extreme adversity can cause us to stand back, look at our lives, and ask ourselves some hard questions: 






THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


"What's really important? Why am I doing what I'm doing? 

But if you're proactive, you don't have to wait for circumstances or other people to create 
perspective-expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own. 

There area number of ways to do this. Through the powers of your imagination, you can visualize 
your own funeral, as wedid at the beginning of this chapter. Write your own eulogy. Actually write 
it out. Be specific. 

You can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your fiftieth wedding anniversary. Have your spouse 
visualize this with you. Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created 
through your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years. 

You can visualize your retirement from your present occupation. What contributions, what 
achievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? 
Will you enter a second career? 

Expand your mind. Visualize in rich detail. Involve as many emotions and feelings as possible. 

I nvol ve as many of the senses as you can. 

I have done similar visualization exercises with some of my university classes. "Assume you only 
have this one semester to live," I tell my students, "and that during this semester you are to stay in 
school as a good student. Visualize how you would spend your semester. 

Things are suddenly placed in a different perspective. Values quickly surface that before weren't 
even recognized. 

I have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of 
their experiences. 

The results are very revealing. They start writing to parents to tell them how much they love and 
appreciate them. They reconcile with a brother, a sister, a friend where the relationship has 
deteriorated. 

The dominant, central theme of their activities, the underlying principle, is love. The futility of 
bad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusation becomes very evident when they think in 
terms of having only a short time to live. Principles and values become more evident to everybody. 

There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your 
values. But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same. When people seriously 
undertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to 
do, they become very reverent. They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. 

Visualization and Affirmation 

Personal leadership is not a singular experience. It doesn't begin and end with the writing of a 
personal mission statement. It is, rather, the ongoing process of keeping your vision and values before 
you and aligning your life to becongruent with those most important things. And in that effort, your 
powerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to you on a daily basis as you work to integrate your 
personal mission statement into your life. It's another application of "Begin with the End in Mind." 

Let's go back to an example we mentioned before. Suppose I am a parent who really deeply loves 
my children. Suppose I identify that as one of my fundamental values in my personal mission 
statement. But suppose, on a daily basis, I have trouble overreacting. 

I can use my right-brain power of visualization to write an "affirmation" that will help me become 
more congruent with my deeper values in my daily life. 

A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it's personal, it's positive, it's present tense, it's visual, 
and it's emotional. So I might write something like this: "It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I 
(personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my 
children misbehave." 








THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brarjt, to you tyHyHsnt 


Then I can visualize it. I can spend a few minutes each day and totally relax my mind and body. I 
can think about situations in which my children might misbehave. I can visualize them in rich detail. 
I can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet, the sweater I'm wearing. 
I can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression on her face. The more clearly and vividly I can 
imagine the detail, the more deeply I will experience it, thelessl will see it as a spectator. 

Then I can see her do something very specific which normally makes my heart pound and my 
temper start to flare. But instead of seeing my normal response, I can see myself handle the situation 
with all the love, the power, the self-control I have captured in my affirmation. I can write the 
program, write the script, in harmony with my values, with my personal mission statement. 

And if I do this, day after day my behavior will change. Instead of living out of the scripts given to 
me by my own parents or by society or by genetics or my environment, I will be living out of the script I 
have written from my own self-selected value system. 

I have helped and encouraged my son, Sean, to use this affirmation process extensively throughout 
his football career. We started when he played quarterback in high school, and eventually, I taught 
him how to do it on his own. 

We would try to get him in a very relaxed state of mind through deep breathing and progressive 
muscle relaxation technique so that he became very quiet inside. Then I would help him visualize 
himself right in the heat of the toughest situations imaginable. 

He would imagine a big blitz coming at him fast. He had to read the blitz and respond. He 
would imagine giving audibles at the line after reading defenses. Hewould imagine quick reads with 
his first receiver, his second receiver, his third receiver. He would imagine options that he normally 
wouldn't do. 

At one point in his football career, he told me he was constantly getting uptight. As we talked, I 
realized that he was visualizing uptightness. So we worked on visualizing relaxation in the middle of 
the big pressure circumstance. We discovered that the nature of the visualization is very important. 
If you visualize the wrong thing, you'll produce the wrong thing. 

Dr. Charles Garfield has done extensive research on peak performers, both in athletics and in 
business. He became fascinated with peak performance in his work with the NASA program, 
watching the astronauts rehearse everything on earth again and again in a simulated environment 
before they went to space. Although he had a doctorate in mathematics, he decided to go back and get 
another Ph.D. in thefield of psychology and study the characteristics of peak performers. 

One of the main things his research showed was that almost all of the world-class athletes and other 
peak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel it; they experience it before they actually do it. 
They Begin with the End in Mind. 

You can do it in every area of your life. Before a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult 
confrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, relentlessly, over and over 
again. Create an internal "comfort zone." Then, when you get into the situation, it isn't foreign. It 
doesn't scare you. 

Your creative, visual right brain is one of your most important assets, both in creating your personal 
mission statement and in integrating it into your life. 

There is an entire body of literature and audio and video tapes that deals with this process of 
visualization and affirmation. Some of the more recent developments in this field include such things 
as subliminal programming, neurolinguistic programming, and new forms of relaxation and self-talk 
processes. These all involve explanation, elaboration, and different packaging of the fundamental 
pri nci pi es of the fi rst creation. 

My review of the success literature brought me in contact with hundreds of books on this subject. 
Although some made extravagant claims and relied on anecdotal rather than scientific evidence, I think 
that most of the material is fundamentally sound. The majority of it appears to have originally come 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


out of the study of the Bible by many individuals. 

In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a 
foundation of well thought through purposes and principles that become the center of a person's life. 
They are extremely powerful in rescripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to 
purposes and principles into one's heart and mind. I believe that central to all enduring religions in 
society are the same principles and practices clothed in different language -- meditation, prayer, 
covenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, compassion, and many different forms of the use of 
both conscience and imagination. 

But if these techniques become part of the personal ity ethic and are severed from a base of character 
and principles, they can be misused and abused in serving other centers, primarily the self center. 

Affirmation and visualization are forms of programming, and we must be certain that we do not 
submit ourselves to any programming that is not in harmony with our basic center or that comes from 
sources centered on money-making, self interest, or anything other than correct principles. 

The imagination can be used to achieve the fleeting success that comes when a person is focused on 
material gain or on "what's in it for me." But I believe the higher use of imagination is in harmony with 
the use of conscience to transcend self and create a life of contribution based on unique purpose and on 
the principles that govern interdependent reality. 

Identifying Roles and Goals 

Of course, the logical/verbal left brain becomes important also as you attempt to capture your 
right-brain images, feelings, and pictures in the words of a written mission statement. Just as 
breathing exercises help integrate body and mind, writing is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity 
which helps bridge and integrate the conscious and subconscious minds. Writing distills, crystallizes, 
and clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts. 

We each have a number of different roles in our lives -- different areas or capacities in which we 
have responsibility. I may, for example, have a role as an individual, a husband, a father, a teacher, a 
church member, and a businessman. And each of these roles is important. 

One of the major problems that arises when peopleworkto become more effective in life is that they 
don't think broadly enough. They lose the sense of proportion, the balance, the natural ecology 
necessary to effective living. They may get consumed by work and neglect personal health. In the 
name of professional success, they may neglect the most precious relationships in their lives. 

You may find that your mission statement will be much more balanced, much easier to work with, if 
you break it down into the specific role areas of your life and the goals you want to accomplish in each 
area. Look at your professional role. You might be a salesperson, or a manager, or a product 
developer. Whatareyou about in that area? What are the values that should guide you? Think of your 
personal roles -- husband, wife, father, mother, neighbor, friend. What are you about in those roles? 
What's important to you? Think of community roles -- the political area, public service, volunteer 
organizations. 

One executive has used the idea of roles and goals to create the foil owing mission statement: 

My mission isto livewith integrity and to make a difference in the lives of others. 

To fulfill this mission: 

I have charity: I seek out and love the one-- each one-- regardless of his situation. 

I sacrifice: I devote my time, talents, and resources to my mission. 

I inspire: I teach by example that we are all children of a loving Heavenly Father and that every 
Goliath can be overcome. 

I am impactful: What I do makes a difference in the lives of others. 

These roles take priority in achieving my mission: 




THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyRtflwrt 


Husband -- my partner is the most important person in my life. Together we contribute the fruits 
of harmony, industry, charity, and thrift. 

Father --1 help my children experience progressively greater joy in their lives. 

Son/ Brother --1 am frequently "there" for support and love. 

Christian --God can count on me to keep my covenants and to serve his other children. 

Neighbor-The love of Christ is visiblethrough my actions toward others. 

ChangeAgent- I am a catalyst for developing high performance in large organizations. 

Scholar - I learn important new things every day. 

Writing your mission in terms of the important roles in your life gives you balance and harmony. 
It keeps each roleclearly before you. You can review your roles frequently to make sure that you don't 
get totally absorbed by one role to the exclusion of others that are equally or even more important in 
your life. 

After you identify your various roles, then you can think about the Long Term Goals are plans you 
make that support the principles described in your M ission Statement. These goals should represent 
areas you want to focus on in the near future. Typically, Long Term Goals take longer than a week to 
complete, but are most specific than the lifetime goals of your M ission Statement.long-term goals you 
want to accomplish in each of those roles. We're into the right brain again, using imagination, 
creativity, conscience, and inspiration. If these goals are the extension of a mission statement based on 
correct principles, they will be vitally different from the goals people normally set. They will be in 
harmony with correct principles, with natural laws, which gives you greater power to achieve them. 
They are not someone else's goals you have absorbed. They are your goals. They reflect your deepest 
values, your uniquetalent, your sense of mission. And they grow out of your chosen roles in life. 

An effective goal focuses primarily on results rather than activity. It identifies where you want to 
be, and, in the process, helps you determine where you are. It gives you important information on 
how to get there, and it tells you when you have arrived. It unifies your efforts and energy. It gives 
meaning and purpose to all you do. And it can finally translate itself into daily activities so that you 
are proactive, you arein charge of your life, you are making happen each day the things that will enable 
you to fulfill your personal mission statement. 

Roles and goals give structure and organized direction to your personal mission. If you don't yet 
havea personal mission statement, it's a good place to begin. Just identifying the various areas of your 
life and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead 
gives you an overall perspectiveof your life and a sense of direction. 

As we move into Habit 3, we'll go into greater depth in the area of short-term goals. The important 
application at this point is to identify roles and long-term goals as they relate to your personal mission 
statement. These roles and long-term goals will provide the foundation for effective goal setting and 
achieving when we get to the H abit 3 day-to-day management of I ife and ti me. 

Family M ission Statements 

Because Habit 2 is based on principle, it has broad application. In addition to individuals, families, 
service groups, and organizations of all kinds become significantly more effective as they Begin with the 
End in Mind. 

Many families are managed on the basis of crises, moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification - not 
on sound principles. Symptoms surface whenever stress and pressure mount: people become cynical, 
critical, or silent or they start yelling and overreacting. Children who observe these kinds of behavior 
grow up thinking the only way to solve problems isflight or fight. 

The core of any family is what is changeless, what is always going to be there - shared vision and 
values. By writing a family mission statement, you give expression to itstruefoundation. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


This mission statement becomes its constitution, the standard, the criterion for evaluation and 
decision making. It gives continuity and unity to the family as well as direction. When individual 
values are harmonized with those of the family, members work together for common purposes that are 
deeply felt. 

Again, the process is as important as the product. The very process of writing and refining a 
mission statement becomes a key way to improve the family. Working together to create a mission 
statement builds the PC capacity to live it. 

By getting input from every family member, drafting a statement, getting feedback, revising it, and 
using wording from different family members, you get the family talking, communicating, on things 
that really matter deeply. The best mission statements are the result of family members coming 
together in a spirit of mutual respect, expressing their different views, and working together to create 
something greater than any one individual could do alone. Periodic review to expand perspective, 
shift emphasis or direction, amend or give new meaning to time-worn phrases can keep the family 
united in common values and purposes. 

The mission statement becomes the framework for thinking, for governing the family. When the 
problems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter 
most and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making based on correct principles. 

In our home, we put our mission statement up on a wall in the family room so that wecan look at it 
and monitor ourselves daily. When we read the phrases about the sounds of love in our home, order, 
responsible independence, cooperation, helpfulness, meeting needs, developing talents, showing 
interest in each other's talents, and giving service to others it gives us some criteria to know how we're 
doing in the things that matter most to us as a family. 

When we plan our family goal sand activities, we say, "In light of these principles, what are the goals 
we're goi ng to work on? What are our action plans to accompl ish our goals and actual ize these val ues?" 

We review the statement frequently and rework goals and jobs twice a year, in September and June 
-- the beginning of school and the end of school -- to reflect the situation as it is, to improve it, to 
strengthen it. It renews us, it recommits us to what we believe in, what we stand for. 

Organizational Mission Statements 

M ission statements are also vital to successful organizations. One of the most important thrusts of 
my work with organizations is to assist them in developing effective mission statements. And to be 
effective, that statement has to come from within the bowels of the organization. Everyone should 
participate in a meaningful way -- not just the top strategy planners, but everyone. Once again, the 
involvement process is as important as the written product and is the key to its use. 

I am always intrigued whenever I go to IBM and watch the training process there. Time and time 
again, I see the leadership of the organization come into a group and say that IBM stands for three 
things: thedignity of theindividual, excellence, and service. 

These things represent the belief system of IBM. Everything elsewill change, but these three things 
will not change. Almost I ike osmosis, this belief system has spread throughout the entire organization, 
providing a tremendous base of shared values and personal security for everyone who works there. 

Once I was training a group of people for IBM in New York. It was small group, about 20 people, 
and one of them became i 11. Hecalled his wife in California, who expressed concern because his illness 
required a special treatment. The IBM people responsible for the training session arranged to have 
him taken to an excellent hospital with medical specialists in thedisease. But they could sense that his 
wife was uncertain and really wanted him home where their personal physician could handle the 
problem. 

So they decided to get him home. Concerned about the time involved in driving him to the airport 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyu tyH^Havt 


and waiting for a commercial plane, they brought in a helicopter, flew him to the airport, and hired a 
special planejust to take this man to California. 

I don't know what costs that involved; my guess would be many thousands of dollars. But IBM 
believes in the dignity of the individual. That's what the company stands for. To those present, that 
experience represented its belief system and was no surprise. I was impressed. 

At another time, I was scheduled to train 175 shopping center managers at a particular hotel. I was 
amazed at the level of service there. It wasn't a cosmetic thing. It was evident at all levels, 
spontaneously, without supervision. 

I arrived quite late, checked in, and asked if room service were available. The man at the desk said, 
"No, Mr. Covey, but if you're interested, I could go back and get a sandwich or a salad or whatever 
you'd like that we have in the kitchen." His attitude was one of total concern about my comfort and 
welfare. "Would you I ike to see your convention room?" he continued. "Do you have everything you 
need? What can I do for you? I'm hereto serve you." 

There was no supervisor there checking up. This man was sincere. 

The next day I was in the middle of a presentation when I discovered that I didn't have all the 
colored markers I needed. So I went out into the hall during the brief break and found a bellboy 
running to another convention. "I've got a problem," I said. "I'm here training a group of managers 
and I only have a short break. I need some more colored pens. 

He whipped around and almost came to attention. He glanced at my name tag and said, "Mr. 
Covey, I will solve your problem." 

He didn't say, "I don't know whereto go" or "well, go and check the front desk." He just took care of 
it. And hemademefeel likeitwashisprivilegetodoso. 

Later, I was in the side lobby, looking at some of the art objects. Someone from the hotel came up 
to me and said, "M r. Covey, would you like to see a book that describes the art objects in this hotel?" 
H ow anti ci patory! H ow service-oriented! 

I next observed one of the employees high up on a ladder cleaning windows in the lobby. From his 
vantage point he saw a woman having a little difficulty in the garden with a walker. She hadn't really 
fallen, and she was with other people. But he climbed down that ladder, went outside, helped the 
woman into the lobby and saw that she was properly taken care of. Then he went back and finished 
cleaning thewindows. 

I wanted to find out how this organization had created a culture where people bought so deeply into 
the value of customer service. I interviewed housekeepers, waitresses, bellboys in that hotel and 
found that this attitude had impregnated the minds, hearts, and attitudes of every employee there. 

I went through the back door into the kitchen, where I saw the central value: "Uncompromising 
personalized service." I finally went to the manager and said, "My business is helping organizations 
develop a powerful team character, a team culture. I am amazed at what you have here." 

"Do you want to know the real key?" he inquired. Hepulled out the mission statement for the hotel 
chain. 

After reading it, I acknowledged, 'That's an impressive statement. But I know many companies 
that have impressive mission statements." 

"Do you want to see the one for this hotel?" he asked. 

"Do you mean you developed one just for this hotel?" 

"Yes." 

"D ifferent from the one for the hotel chai n?" 

"Yes. It's in harmony with that statement, but this one pertains to our situation, our environment, 
our time." He handed me another paper. 

"Who developed this mission statement?" I asked. 

"Everybody," he replied. 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


"Everybody? Really, everybody?" 

"Yes." 

"H ousekeepers?" 

"Yes." 

"Waitresses?" 

"Yes." 

"Desk clerks?" 

"Yes. Do you want to seethe mission statement written by the people who greeted you last night?" 
He pulled out a mission statement that they, themselves, had written that was interwoven with all the 
other mission statements. Everyone, at every level, was involved. 

The mission statement for that hotel was the hub of a great wheel. It spawned the thoughtful, more 
specialized mission statements of particular groups of employees. It was used as the criterion for 
every decision that was made. It clarified what those people stood for -- how they related to the 
customer, how they related to each other. It affected the style of the managers and the leaders. It 
affected the compensation system. It affected the kind of people they recruited and how they trained 
and developed them. Every aspect of that organization, essentially, was a function of that hub, that 
mission statement. 

I later visited another hotel in the same chain, and the first thing I did when I checked in was to ask 
to see their mission statement, which they promptly gave me. At this hotel, I came to understand the 
motto "Uncompromising personalized service" a little more. 

For a three-day period, I watched every conceivable situation where service was called for. I 
always found that service was delivered in a very impressive, excellent way. But it was always also 
very personalized. For instance, in the swimming area I asked the attendant where the drinking 
fountainwas. He walked me to it. 

But the thing that impressed me the very most was to see an employee, on his own, admit a mistake 
to his boss. Weordered room service, and were told when it would bedelivered to the room. On the 
way to our room, the room service person spilled the hot chocolate, and it took a few extra minutes to 
go back and change the linen onthetray and replace the drink. So the room service was about fifteen 
minutes late, which was really not that important to us. 

Nevertheless, the next morning the room service manager phoned us to apologize and invited us to 
have either the buffet breakfast or a room service breakfast, compliments of the hotel, to in some way 
compensate for the inconvenience. 

What does it say about the culture of an organization when an employee admits his own mistake, 
unknown to anyone else, to the manager so that customer or guest is better taken care of! 

As I told the manager of the first hotel I visited, I know a lot of companies with impressive mission 
statements. But there is a real difference, all the difference in the world, in the effectiveness of a 
mission statement created by everyone involved in the organization and one written by a few top 
executives behind a mahogany wall. 

One of the fundamental problems in organizations, including families, is that people are not 
committed to the determinations of other people for their lives. They simply don't buy into them. 

Many times as I work with organizations, I find people whose goals are totally different from the 
goals of the enterprise. I commonly find reward systems completely out of alignment with stated 
value systems. 

When I begin work with companies that have already developed some kind of mission statement, I 
ask them, "How many of the people here know that you have a mission statement? How many of you 
know what it contains? How many were involved in creating it? How many really buy into it and use it 
as your frame of reference in making decisions?" 

Without involvement, there is no commitment. Mark it down, asterisk it, circle it, underline it.

No involvement, no commitment. 

Now, in the early stages -- when a person is new to an organization or when a child in the family is 
young -- you can pretty well give them a goal and they'll buy it, particularly if the relationship, 
orientation, and training are good. 

But when people become more mature and their own lives take on a separate meaning, they want 
involvement, significant involvement. And if they don't have that involvement, they don't buy it. 
Then you have a significant motivational problem which cannot be solved at the same level of thinking 
that created it. 

That's why creating an organizational mission statement takes time, patience, involvement, skill, and 
empathy. Again, it's not a quick fix. It takes time and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage 
and integrity to align systems, structure, and management style to the shared vision and values. But 
it's based on correct principles and it works. 

An organizational mission statement -- one that truly reflects the deep shared vision and values of 
everyone within that organization -- creates a great unity and tremendous commitment. It creates in 
people's hearts and minds a frame of reference, a set of criteria or guidelines, by which they will govern 
themselves. They don't need someone else directing, controlling, criticizing, or taking cheap shots. 
They have bought i nto the changel ess core of w hat the organization i s about. 

Application Suggestions 

1. Take the time to record the impressions you had in the funeral visualization at the beginning of 
this chapter. You may want to use the chart below to organize your thoughts. 

2. Take a few moments and write down your roles as you now see them. Are you satisfied with 
that mi rror i mage of your I ife. 

3. Set up time to completely separate yourself from daily activities and to begin work on your 
personal mission statement. 

4. Go through the chart in Appendix A showing different centers and circle all those you can 
identify with. Do they form a pattern for the behavior in your life? Are you comfortable with the 
implications of your analysis. 

5. Start a collection of notes, quotes, and ideas you may want to use as resource material in writing 
your .personal mission statement. 

6. Identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply the principles of mental 
creation. Writedown the results you desire and what steps will lead to those results. 

7. Share the principles of Habit 2 with your family or work group and suggest that together you 
begin the process of developing a family or group mission statement.

Will you takejust a moment and writedown a short answer to the following two questions? Your 
answerswill be important to you as you begin work on Habit3. 

Question 1: What one thing could you do (you aren't doing now) that if you did on a regular basis, 
would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life? 

Question 2: Whatonething in your business or professional life would bring similar results? 

We'll come back to these answers later. But first, let's put H abit 3 in perspective 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


Habit 3 is the personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of Habits land 2. 

Habit 1 says, "You're the creator. You are in charge." It's based on the four unique human 
endowments of imagination, conscience, independent will, and particularly, self-awareness. It 
empowers you to say, 'That's an unhealthy program I've been given from my childhood, from my social 
mirror. I don't I ike that ineffective script. I can change." 

Habit 2 is the first or mental creation. It's based on imagination--the ability to envision, to seethe 
potential, to create with our minds what we cannot at present see without eyes; and conscience -- the 
ability to detect our own uniqueness and the personal, moral, and ethical guidelines within which we 
can most happily fulfill it. It's the deep contact with our basic paradigms and values and the vision of 
what we can become. 

Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation. It's the fulfillment, the actualization, 
the natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2. It's the exercise of independent will toward becoming 
principle-centered. It's the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it. 

Habits 1 and 2 are absolutely essential and prerequisite to Habit 3. You can't become 
principle-centered without first being aware of and developing your own proactive nature. You can't 
become principle-centered without first being aware of your paradigms and understanding how to shift 
them and align them with principles. You can't become principle-centered without a vision of and a 
focus on the uniquecontribution that is yours to make. 

But with that foundation, you can become principle-centered, day-in and day-out, 
moment-by-moment, by living Habit3- by practicing effective self-management. 

Management, remember, is clearly different from leadership. Leadership is primarily a 
high-powered, right-brain activity. It's more of an art; it's based on a philosophy. You have to ask 
the ulti mate questions of life when you'redealing with personal leadership issues. 

But once you have dealt with those issues, once you have resolved them, you then have to manage 
yourself effectively to create a life congruent with your answers. The ability to manage well doesn't 
make much difference if you're not even in the "right jungle." But if you are in the right jungle, it 
makes all the difference. In fact, the ability to manage well determines the quality and even the 
existence of the second creation. M anagement is the breaking down, the analysis, the sequencing, the 
specific application, the time-bound left-brain aspect of effective self-government. My own maxim of 
personal effectiveness isthis: Manage from the left; lead from the right. 

The Power of Independent Will 

In addition to self-awareness, imagination, and conscience, it is the fourth human endowment -- 
independent will -- that really makes effective self-management possible. It is the ability to make 
decisions and choices and to act in accordance with them. It is the ability to act rather than to beaded 
upon, to proadively carry out the program we have developed through the other three endowments. 

The human will is an amazing thing. Time after time, it has triumphed against unbelievable odds. 
The H elen Kellers of this world give dramatic evidence to the value, the power of the independent will. 

But as we examine this endowment in the context of effedive self-management, we realize it's 
usually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a-lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings 
enduring success. Empowerment comes from the learning how to use this great endowment in the 
decisions we make every day. 

The degree to which we have developed our independent will in our everyday lives is measured by 
our personal integrity. Integrity is, fundamentally, the value we place on ourselves. It'sour ability to 
make and keep commitments to ourselves, to "walk our talk." It's honor with self, a fundamental 
part of the charader ethic, the essence of proadi ve growth. 

Effedive management is putting first things first. While leadership decides what "first things" are, 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


it is management that puts them first, day-by-day, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, 
carrying it out. 

Discipline derives from disciple-- disci pie to a philosophy, disci pie to a set of principles, disci pie to 
a set of values, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents 
that goal. 

In other words, if you are an effective manager of your self, your discipline comes from within; it is a 
function of your independent will. You area disciple, a follower, of your own deep values and their 
source. And you havethewill, the integrity, to subordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods 
to those values. 

One of my favorite essays is "The Common Denominator of Success," written by E. M. Gray. He 
spent his life searching for the one denominator that all successful people share. He found it wasn't 
hard work, good luck, or astute human relations, though thosewereall important. The one factor that 
seemed to transcend all the rest embodies the essence of Habit 3: Putting First Things First. 

'The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do," he observed. 
'They don't like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of 
their purpose." 

That subordination requires a purpose, a mission, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a 
burning "Yes!" inside that makes it possible to say "no" to other things. It also requires independent 
will, the power to do something when you don't want to do it, to be a function of your values rather 
than a function of the impulse or desire of any given moment. It's the power to act with integrity to 
your proactive first creation. 

Four G enerations of Time M anagement 

In Habit 3 we are dealing with many of the questions addressed in the field of life and time 
management. As a longtime student of this fascinating field, I am personally persuaded that the 
essence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: 
Organize and execute around priorities. That phrase represents the evolution of three generations of 
time-management theory, and how to best do it is the focus of a wide variety of approaches and 
materials. 

Personal management has evolved in a pattern similar to many other areas of human endeavor. 
Major developmental thrusts, or "waves" as Alvin Toffler calls them, follow each other in succession, 
each adding a vital new dimension. For example, in social development, the agricultural revolution 
was followed by the industrial revolution, which was followed by the informational revolution. Each 
succeeding wave created a surge of social and personal progress. 

Likewise, in the area of time management, each generation builds on the one before it -- each one 
moves us toward greater control of our lives. The first wave or generation could be characterized by 
notes and checklists, an effort to give some semblance of recognition and inclusiveness to the many 
demands placed on our time and energy. 

The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave 
reflects an attempt to look ahead, to schedule events and activities in the future. 

The third generation reflects the current time-management field. It adds to those preceding 
generations the important idea of prioritization, of clarifying values, and of comparing the relative 
worth of activities based on their relationship to those values. In addition, itfocuses on setting goals -- 
specific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targets toward which time and energy would be directed 
in harmony with values. It also includes the concept of daily planning, of making a specific plan to 
accomplish those goalsand activities determined to be of greatest worth. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


While the third generation has made a significant contribution, people have begun to realize that 
"efficient" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates 
expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and 
to enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis. 

As a result, many people have become turned off by time management programs and planners that 
make them feel too scheduled, too restricted, and they "throw the baby out with the bath water," 
reverting to first- or second-generation techniques to preserve relationships, to meet human needs, and 
to enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis. 

But there is an emerging fourth generation that is different in kind. It recognizes that "time 
management" is really a misnomer -- the challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves. 
Satisfaction is a function of expectation as well as realization. And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in 
our Circle of Influence. 

Rather than focusing on things and time, fourth-generation expectations focus on preserving and 
enhancing relationships and accomplishing results-- in short, on maintaining the P/ PC Balance. 

Quadrant II 

The essential focus of the fourth generation of management can be captured in the Time 
Management Matrix diagrammed on the next page. Basically, wespend time in oneof four ways. 

As you see, the two factors that define an activity are urgent and important. Urgent means it 
requires immediate attention. It's "Now!" Urgent things act on us. A ringing phone is urgent. Most 
people can't stand the thought of just allowing the phone to ring. You could spend hours preparing 
materials, you could get all dressed up and travel to a person's office to discuss a particular issue, but if 
the phone were to ring while you were there, it would generally take precedence over your personal 
visit. 

If you were to phone someone, there aren't many people who would say, "I'll get to you in 15 
minutes; just hold." But those same people would probably let you wait in an office for at least that 
long whilethey completed a telephone conversation with someone else. 

Urgent matters are usually visible. They press on us; they insist on action. They're often popular 
with others. They're usually right in front of us. And often they are pleasant, easy, fun to do. But so 
often they are unimportant! 

Importance, on the other hand, has to do with results. If something is important, it contributes to 
your mission, your values, your high priority goals. 

We react to urgent matters. Important matters that are not urgent require more initiative, more 
proactivity. We must act to seize opportunity, to make things happen. If we don't practice Habit 2, if 
we don't have a clear idea of what is important, of the results we desire in our lives, we are easily 
diverted into responding to the urgent. 

Look for a moment at the four quadrants in the Time Management Matrix. Quadrant I is both 
urgent and important. It deals with significant results that require immediate attention. Weusually 
call the activities in Quadrant I "crises" or "problems." We all have some Quadrant I activities in our 
lives. But Quadrant I consumes many people. They are crisis managers, problem-minded people, the 
deadline-driven producers. 

As long as you focus on Quadrant I, it keeps getting bigger and bigger until it dominates you. It's 
like the pounding surf. A huge problem comes and knocks you down and you're wiped out. You 
struggle back up only to face another one that knocks you down and slams you to the ground. 

Some people are literally beaten up by the problems all day every day. The only relief they have is 
in escaping to the not important, not urgent activities of Quadrant IV. So when you look at their total 
matrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and most of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


with only negligible attention paid to Quadrants II and III. That's how peoplewho manage their lives 
by crisis live. 

There are other people who spend a great deal of time in "urgent, but not important" Quadrant III, 
thinking they're in Quadrant I. They spend most of their time reacting to things that are urgent, 
assuming they are also important. But the reality is that the urgency of these matters is often based on 
the priorities and expectations of others. 

Peoplewho spend time almost exclusively in Quadrants III and IV basically lead irresponsible lives. 

Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because, urgent or not, they aren't important. 
They also shrink Quadrant I down to size by spending more time in Quadrant II. 

Quadrant 11 is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, 
but are important. It deals with things like building relationships, writing a personal mission 
statement, long-range planning, exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation -- all those things we 
know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren't urgent. 

To paraphrase Peter Drucker, effective people are not problem-minded; they're opportunity-minded. 
They feed opportunities and starve problems. They think preventively. They have genuine 
Quadrant I crises and emergencies that require their immediate attention, but the number is 
comparatively small. They keep P and PC in balance by focusing on the important, but not the urgent, 
hi gh-1 everage capaci ty-bu i I d i ng acti vi ti es of Q uad rant 11. 

With the Time Management Matrix in mind, take a moment now and consider how you answered 
the questions at the beginning of this chapter. What quadrant do they fit in? Are they important? 
A re they urgent? 

My guess is that they probably fit into Quadrant II. They are obviously important, deeply 
important, but not urgent. And because they aren't urgent, you don't do them. 

Now look again at the nature of those questions: What one thing could you do in your personal and 
professional life that, if you did on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in 
your life? Quadrant II activities have that kind of impact. Our effectiveness takes the quantum leaps 
when we do them. 

I asked a similar question to a group of shopping center managers. "If you were to do one thing in 
your professional work that you know would have enormously positive effects on the results, what 
would it be?" Their unanimous response was to build helpful personal relationships with the tenants, 
the owners of the stores inside the shopping center, which isaQuadrant II activity. 

We did an analysis of the time they were spending on that activity. It was less than 5 percent. 
They had good reasons - problems, one right after another. They had reports to make out, meetings 
to go to, correspondence to answer, phone calls to make, constant interruptions. Quadrant I had 
consumed them. 

They were spending very little time with the store managers, and the time they did spend was filled 
with negative energy. The only reason they visited the store managers at all was to enforce the 
contract -- to collect the money or discuss advertising or other practices that were out of harmony with 
center guidelines, or some similar thing. 

The store owners were struggling for survival, let alone prosperity. They had employment 
problems, cost problems, inventory problems, and a host of other problems. Most of them had no 
training in management at all. Some were fairly good merchandisers, but they needed help. The 
tenants didn't even want to see the shopping center owners; they were just one more problem to 
contend with. 

So the owners decided to be proactive. They determined their purpose, their values, their priorities. 
In harmony with those priorities, they decided to spend about one-third of their time in helping 
relationships with the tenants. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


In working with that organization for about a year and a half, I saw them climb to around 20 percent, 
which represented more than a fourfold increase. In addition, they changed their role. They became 
listeners, trainers, consultants to the tenants. Their interchanges were filled with positive energy. 

The effect was dramatic, profound. By focusing on relationships and results rather than time and 
methods, the numbers went up, the tenants were thrilled with the results created by new ideas and 
skills, and the shopping center managers were more effective and satisfied and increased their list of 
potential tenants and lease revenue based on increased sales by the tenant stores. They were no longer 
policemen or hovering supervisors. They were problem solvers, helpers. 

Whether you are a student at the university, a worker in an assembly line, a homemaker, fashion 
designer, or president of a company, I believe that if you were to ask what lies in Quadrant II and 
cultivate the proactivity to go after it, you would find the same results. Your effectiveness would 
increase dramatically. Your crises and problems would shrink to manageable proportions because 
you would bethinking ahead, working on the roots, doing the preventive things that keep situations 
from developing into crises in the first place. In the time management jargon, this is called the Pareto 
Principle-- 80 percent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities. 

What it Takes to Say "No" 

Theonly placeto gettimefor Quadrant II in the beginning isfrom Quadrants III and IV. You can't 
ignore the urgent and important activities of Quadrant I, although it will shrink in size as you spend 
more time with prevention and preparation in Quadrant II. But the initial time for Quadrant II has 
come out of III and IV. 

You have to be proactive to work on Quadrant II because Quadrant I and III work on you. To say 
"yes" to important Quadrant II priorities, you have to learn to say "no" to other activities, sometimes 
apparently urgent things. 

Some time ago, my wife was invited to serve as chairman of a committee in a community endeavor. 
She had a number of truly important things she was trying to work on, and she really didn't want to do 
it. But she felt pressured into it and finally agreed. 

Then she called one of her dear friends to ask if she would serve on her committee. Her friend 
listened for a long time and then said, "Sandra, that sounds like a wonderful project, a really worthy 
undertaking. I appreciate so much your inviting me to be a part of it. I feel honored by it. For a 
number of reasons, I won't be participating myself, but I want you to know how much I appreciate your 
invitation." 

Sandra was ready for anything but a pleasant "no." She turned to me and sighed, "I wish I'd said 
that." 

I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't be involved in significant service projects. Those things 
are important. But you have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage -- 
pleasantly, smiling, nonapologetically -- to say "no" to other things. And the way you do that is by 
having a bigger "yes" burning inside. The enemy of the "best" is often the "good." 

Keep in mind that you are always saying "no" to something. If it isn't to the apparent, urgent 
things in your life, it is probably to the more fundamental, highly important things. Even when the 
urgent is good, the good can keep you from your best, keep you from your unique contributions, if you 
let it. 

When I was Director of University Relations at a large university, I hired a very talented, proactive, 
creative writer. One day, after he had been on the job for a few months, I went into his office and 
asked hi m to work on some urgent matters that were pressi ng on me. 

He said, "Stephen, I'll do whatever you want me to do. Just let me share with you my situation." 

Then he took me over to his wall board, where he had listed over two dozen projects he was 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyR^Hairt 


working on, together with performance criteria and deadline dates that had been clearly negotiated 
before. He was highly disciplined, which is why I went to see him in the first place. "If you want to 
get something done, give it to a busy man." 

Then he said, "Stephen, to do the jobs that you want done right would take several days. Which of 
these projects would you like me to delay or cancel to satisfy your request?" 

Well, I didn't want to take the responsibility for that. I didn't want to put a cog in the wheel of one 
of the most productive people on the staff just because I happened to be managing by crisis at the time. 
The jobs I wanted done were urgent, but not important. So I went and found another crisis manager 
and gave the job to him. 

Wesay "yes" or "no" to things daily, usually many times a day. A center of correct principles and a 
focus on our personal mission empowers us with wisdom to makethosejudgments effectively. 

As I work with different groups, I tell them that the essence of effective time and life management is 
to organize and execute around balanced priorities. Then I ask this question: if you were to fault 
yourself in one of three areas, which would it be: (1) the inability to prioritize; (2) the inability or desire 
to organize around those priorities; or (3) the lack of discipline to execute around them, to stay with 
your priorities and organization? 

Most peoplesay their main fault is a lack of discipline. On deeper thought, I believe that is not the 
case. The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and 
minds. They haven't really internalized Habit 2. 

There are many peoplewho recognize the value of Quadrant II activities in their lives, whether they 
identify them as such or not. And they attempt to give priority to those activities and integrate them 
into their lives through self-discipline alone. But without a principle center and a personal mission 
statement, they don't have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts. They're working on the 
leaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of discipline, without even thinking to examine the roots, the 
basic paradigms from which their natural attitudes and behaviors flow. 

A Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center. If you are centered on your 
spouse, your money, your friends, your pleasure, or any extrinsic factor, you will keep getting thrown 
back into Quadrants I and III, reacting to the outside forces your life is centered on. Even if you're 
centered on yourself, you'll end up in I and II reacting to the impulse of the moment. Your 
independent will alone cannot effectively discipline you against your center. 

In the words of the architectural maxim, form follows function. Likewise, management follows 
leadership. The way you spend your time is a result of the way you see your time and the way you 
really see your priorities. If your priorities grow out of a principle center and a personal mission, if 
they aredeeply planted in your heart and in your mind, you will see Quadrant II as a natural, exciting 
p I ace to i n vest you r ti me. 

It's almost impossible to say, "no" to the popularity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to 
Quadrant IV if you don't have a bigger "yes" burning inside. Only when you have the self-awareness 
to examine your program -- and the imagination and conscience to create a new, unique, 
principle-centered program to which you can say "yes" -- only then will you have sufficient 
independent will power to say "no," with a genuine smile, to the unimportant. 

Moving Into Quadrant II 

If Quadrant 11 activities are clearly the heart of effective personal management -- the "first things" we 
need to put first-- then how do we organize and execute around those things 

The first generation of time management does not even recognize the concept of priority. It gives 
us notes and "to do" lists that we can cross off, and we feel a temporary sense of accomplishment every 
time we check something off, but no priority is attached to items on the list. In addition, there is no 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


correlation between what's on the list and our ultimate values and purposes in life. We simply 
respond to whatever penetrates our awareness and apparently needs to be done. 

Many people manage from this first-generation paradigm. It's the course of least resistance. 
There's no pain or strain; it's fun to "go with the flow." Externally imposed disciplines and schedules 
give people the feeling that they aren't responsible for results. 

But first-generation managers, by definition, are not effective people. They produce very little, and 
their life-style does nothing to build their Production Capability. Buffeted by outside forces, they are 
often seen as undependable and irresponsible, and they havevery littlesenseof control and self-esteem. 

Second-generation managers assume a little more control. They plan and schedule in advance and 
generally are seen as more responsible because they "show up" when they're supposed to. 

But again, the activities they schedule have no priority or recognized correlation to deeper values 
and goals. They have few significant achievements and tend to be schedule-oriented. 

Third-generation managers take a significant step forward. They clarify their values and set goals. 
They plan each day and prioritize their activities. 

Asl havesaid, this is where most of the time-management field istoday. But this third generation 
has some critical limitations. First, it limits vision--daily planning often misses important things that 
can only be seen from a larger perspective. The very language "daily planning" focuses on the urgent 
-- the "now." While third generation prioritization provides order to activity, it doesn't question the 
essential importance of the activity in the first place -- it doesn't place the activity in the context of 
principles, personal mission, roles, and goals. The third-generation value-driven daily planning 
approach basically prioritizes the Quadrant I and III problems and crises of the day. 

In addition, the third generation makes no provision for managing roles in a balanced way. It lacks 
realism, creating the tendency to over-schedule the day, resulting in frustration and the desire to 
occasionally throw away the plan and escape to Quadrant IV. And its efficiency, time-management 
focus tendsto strain relationships rather than build them. 

While each of the three generations has recognized the value of some kind of management tool, 
none has produced a tool that empowers a person to live a principle-centered, Quadrant II life-style. 
The first-generation note pads and "to do" lists give us no more than a place to capture those things that 
penetrate our awareness so we won't forget them. The second-generation appointment books and 
calendars merely provide a place to record our future commitments so that we can be where we have 
agreed to be at the appropri ate ti me. 

Even thethird generation, with its vast array of planners and materials, focuses primarily on helping 
people prioritize and plan their Quadrant I and III activities. Though many trainers and consultants 
recognize the value of Quadrant II activities, the actual planning tools of the third generation do not 
facilitate organizing and executing around them. 

As each generation builds on those that have preceded it, the strengths and some of the tools of each 
of thefirst three generations provide elemental material for thefourth. But there is an added need for 
a new dimension, for the paradigm and the implementation that will empower us to move into 
Quadrant II, to become principle-centered and to manage ourselves to do what is truly most important. 

The Quadrant 11 Tool 

The objective of Quadrant 11 management is to manage our lives effectively -- from a center of sound 
principles, for a knowledge of our personal mission, with a focus on the important as well as the urgent, 
and within the framework of maintaining a balance between increasing our Production and increasing 
our Production Capability 

This is, admittedly, an ambitious objective for people caught in thethick of thin things in Quadrants 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


III and IV. But striving to achieve it will have a phenomenal impact on personal effectiveness. 

A Quadrant II organizer will need to meet six important criteria. 

Coherence: Coherence suggests that there is harmony, unity, and integrity between your vision 
and mission, your roles and goals, your priorities and plans, and your desires and discipline. In your 
planner, there should be a place for your personal mission statement so that you can constantly refer to 
it. There also needs to bea place for your roles and for both short- and long-term goals. 

Balance: Your tool should help you to keep balance in your life, to identify your various roles and 
keep them right in front of you, so that you don't neglect important areas such as your health, your 
family, professional preparation, or personal development. 

M any people seem to think that success in one area can compensate for failure in other areas of life. 
But can it really? Perhaps it can for a limited time in some areas. But can success in your profession 
compensate for a broken marriage, ruined health, or weakness in personal character? True 
effectiveness requires balance, and your tool needs to help you create and maintain it. 

Quadrant II Focus:. You need a tool that encourages you, motivates you, actually helps you spend 
the time you need in Quadrant II, so that you're dealing with prevention rather than prioritizing crises. 
In my opinion, the best way to do this is to organize your life on a weekly basis. You can still adapt 
and prioritize on a daily basis, but the fundamental thrust is organizing the week. 

Organizing on a weekly basis provides much greater balance and context than daily planning. 
There seems to be implicit cultural recognition of the week as a single, complete unit of time. Business, 
education, and many other facets of society operate within the framework of the week, designating 
certain days for focused investment and others for relaxation or inspiration. The basicJudeo-Christian 
ethic honors the Sabbath, the one day out of every seven set asidefor uplifting purposes. 

Most people think in terms of weeks. But most third-generation planning tools focus on daily 
planning. While they may help you prioritize your activities, they basically only help you organize 
crises and busywork. The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your 
priorities. And this can best be done in the context of the week. 

A "People" Dimension: You also need a tool that deals with people, not just schedules. Whileyou 
can think in terms of efficiency in dealing with time, a principle-centered person thinks in terms of 
effectiveness in dealing with people. There are times when principle-centered Quadrant II living 
requires the subordination of schedules to people. Your tool needs to reflect that value, to facilitate 
implementation rather than create guilt when a schedule is not followed. 

Flexibility: Your planning tool should be your servant, never your master. Since it has to work 
for you, it should be tailored to your style, your needs, your particular ways. 

Portability: Your tool should also be portable, so that you can carry it with you most of the time. 
You may want to review your personal mission statement while riding the bus. You may want to 
measure the value of a new opportunity against something you already have planned. If your 
organizer is portable, you will keep it with you so that important data is always within reach. 

Since Quadrant II is the heart of effective self-management, you need a tool that moves you into 
Quadrant II. My work with the fourth-generation concept has led to the creation of a tool specifically 
designed according to the criteria listed above. But many good third-generation tools can easily be 
adapted. Because the principles are sound, the practices or specific applications can vary from one 
individual to the next. 

Becoming a Quadrant II Self-Manager 

Although my effort here is to teach principles, not practices, of effectiveness, I believe you can better 
understand the principles and the empowering nature of the fourth generation if you actually 
experience organizing a week from a principle-centered, Quadrant II base. 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities. 

Identifying Roles: The first task is to write down your key roles. If you haven't really given 
serious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You 
have a role as an individual. You may want to list one or more roles as a family member -- a husband 
or wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, 
uncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few roles in your work, indicating different areas in which 
you wish to invest time and energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community 
affai rs. 

You don't need to worry about defining the roles in a way that you will live with for the rest of your 
life -- just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the 
next seven days. 

Here are two examples of the way people might see their various roles. 

1. Individual 

2. H usband/ Father 

3. Manager New Products 

4. M anager Research 

5. M anager Staff Dev. 

6. Manager Administration 

7. Chairman United Way 

1. Personal Development 

2. Wife 

3. M other 

4. Real Estate Salesperson 

5. Sunday School Teacher 

6. Symphony Board M ember 

Selecting Goals: The next step is to think of two or three important results you feel you should 
accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals. 

At least some of these goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these short-term goals 
would be tied to the longer-term goals you have identified in conjunction with your personal mission 
statement. But even if you haven't written your mission statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of 
what is important as you consider each of your roles and two or three goals for each role. 

Scheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to 
achieve them. For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission 
statement, you may want to set aside a two-hour block of time on Sunday to work on it. Sunday (or 
some other day of the week that is special to you, your faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal 
time to plan your more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing. It's a good time to 
draw back, to see inspiration, to look at your life in the context of principles and values. 

If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three 
or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal. There 
are some goals that you may only be able to accomplish during business hours, or some that you can 
only do on Saturday when your children are home. Can you begin to see some of the advantages of 
organizi ng the week i nstead of the day? 

Having identified roles and set goals, you can translate each goal to a specific day of the week, either 
as a priority item or, even better, as a specific appointment. You can also check your annual or 
monthly calendar for any appointments you may have previously made and evaluate their importance 
in thecontext of your goals, transferring those you decideto keep to your schedule and making plans to 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


reschedule or cancel others. 

As you study the following weekly worksheet, observe how each of the 19 most important, often 
Quadrant II, goals has been scheduled or translated into a specific action plan. In addition, notice the 
box labeled "Sharpen the Saw TM" that provides a place to plan vital renewing Quadrant II activities in 
each of the four human dimensions that will be explained in Habit 7. 

Even with time set aside to accomplish 19 important goals during the week, look at the amount of 
remaining unscheduled space on the worksheet! Aswell as empowering you to Put First Things First, 
Quadrant II weekly organizing gives you the freedom and the flexibility to handle unanticipated events, 
to shift appointments if you need to, to savor relationships and interactions with others, to deeply enjoy 
spontaneous experiences, knowing that you have proactively organized your week to accomplish key 
goals in every area of your life. 

Daily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly organizing, daily planning becomes more a function of 
daily adapting, or prioritizing activities and responding to unanticipated events, relationships, and 
experiences in a meaningful way. 

Taking a few minutes each morning to review your schedule can put you in touch with the 
value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as unanticipated factors that may 
have come up. As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural 
prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance. It is a softer, more right-brain 
prioritization that ultimately comes out of your sense of personal mission. 

You may still find that the third-generation A, B, C or 1, 2, 3 prioritization gives needed order to 
daily activities. It would be a false dichotomy to say that activities are either important or they aren't. 
They are obviously on a continuum, and some important activities are more important than others. In 
the context of weekly organizing, third-generation prioritization gives order to daily focus. 

But trying to prioritize activities before you even know how they relate to your sense of personal 
mission and how they fit into the balance of your life is not effective. You may be prioritizing and 
accomplishing things you don't want or need to be doing at all. 

Can you begin to see the difference between organizing your week as a principle-centered, 
Quadrant II manager and planning your days as an individual centered on something else? Can you 
begin to sense the tremendous difference the Quadrant II focus would make in your current level of 
effectiveness? 

Having experienced the power of principle-centered Quadrant II organizing in my own life and 
having seen ittransform the lives of hundreds of other people, I am persuaded it makes a difference-- a 
quantum positive difference. And the more completely weekly goals are tied into a wider framework 
of correct principles and into a personal mission statement, the greater the increase in effectiveness will 
be. 

Living It 

Returning once more to the computer metaphor, if Habit 1 says "You're the programmer" and Habit 
2 says "Writethe program," then Habit 3 says "Run the program," "Livethe program." And living it is 
primarily a function of our independent will, our self-discipline, our integrity, and commitment-- not to 
short-term goals and schedules or to the impulse of the moment, but to the correct principles and our 
own deepest values, which give meaning and context to our goals, our schedules, and our lives. 

As you go through your week, there will undoubtedly betimes when your integrity will be placed 
on the line. The popularity of reacting to the urgent but unimportant priorities of other people in 
Quadrant III or the pleasure of escaping to Quadrant IV will threaten to overpower the important 
Quadrant II activities you have planned. Your principle center, your self-awareness, and your 
conscience can provide a high degree of intrinsic security, guidance, and wisdom to empower you to 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


use your independent will and maintain integrity to the truly important. 

But because you aren't omniscient, you can't always know in advance what is truly important. As 
carefully as you organize the week, these will betimes when, as a principle-centered person, you will 
need to subordinate your schedule to a higher value. Because you are principle-centered, you can do 
that with an inner sense of peace. 

At one point, one of my sons was deeply into scheduling and efficiency. One day he had a very 
tight schedule, which included down-to-the-minute time allocations for every activity, including 
picking up some books, washing his car, and "dropping" Carol, his girlfriend, among other things. 

Everything went according to schedule until it came to Carol. They had been dating for a long 
period of time,and he had finally come to the conclusion that a continued relationship would notwork 
out. So, congruent with his efficiency mode, he had scheduled a 10- to 15-minute telephone call to tell 
her. 

But the news was very traumatic to her. One-and-a-half hours later, he was still deeply involved in 
a very intense conversation with her. Even then, the one visit was not enough. The situation was a 
very frustrati ng experi ence for them both. 

Again, you simply can't think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and 
efficiency with things. I've tried to be "efficient" with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it 
simply doesn't work. I've tried to give 10 minutes of "quality time" to a child or an employee to solve a 
problem, only to discover such "efficiency" creates new problems and seldom resolves the deepest 
concern. 

I see many parents, particularly mothers with small children, often frustrated in their desire to 
accomplish a lot because all they seem to do is meet the needs of little children all day. Remember, 
frustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social 
mirror rather than our own values and priorities. 

But if you have Habit 2 deep inside your heart and mind, you have those higher values driving you. 
You can subordinate your schedule to those values with integrity. You can adapt; you can be flexible. 
You don't feel guilty when you don't meet your schedule or when you have to change it. 

Advances of the Fourth G eneration 

One of the reasons why people resist using third-generation time management tools is because they 
lose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible. They subordinate people to schedules because the 
efficiency paradigm of the third generation of management is out of harmony with the principle that 
peopl e are more i mportant than thi ngs. 

The fourth-generation tool recognizes that principle. It also recognizes that the first person you 
need to consider in terms of effectiveness rather than efficiency is yourself. It encourages you to spend 
time in Quadrant II, to understand and center your life on principles, to give clear expression to the 
purposes and values you want to direct your daily decisions. It helps you create balance in your life. 
It helps you rise above the limitations of daily planning and organize and schedule in the context of the 
week. And when a higher value conflicts with what you have planned, it empowers you to use your 
self-awareness and your conscience to maintain integrity to the principles and purposes you have 
determined are most i mportant. Instead of usingaroad map, you're using a compass. 

The fourth generation of self-management is more advanced than the third in five important ways. 

First, it's principle-centered. More than giving lip service to Quadrant II, it creates the central 
paradigm that empowers you to see your ti me i n the context of what is really important and effective 

Second, it's conscience-directed. It gives you the opportunity to organize your life to the best of 
your ability in harmony with your deepest values. But it also gives you the freedom to peacefully 
subordinate your scheduleto higher values. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


Third, it defines your unique mission, including values and long-term goals. This gives direction 
and purpose to the way you spend each day. 

Fourth, it helps you balance your life by identifying roles, and by setting goals and scheduling 
activities in each key role every week. 

And fifth, it gives greater context through weekly organizing (with daily adaptation as needed), 
rising above the limiting perspective of a single day and putting you in touch with your deepest values 
through review of your key roles. 

The practical thread running through all five of these advances is a primary focus on relationships 
and results and a secondary focus on time. 

Delegation: Increasing P and PC 

We accomplish all that we do through delegation -- either to time or to other people. If we 
delegate to time, wethink efficiency. If we delegate to other people, wethink effectiveness. 

M any people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much ti me and effort 
and they could do the job better themselves. But effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single 
most powerful high-leverage activity there is. 

Transferring responsibility to other skilled and trained people enables you to give your energies to 
other high-leverage activities. Delegation means growth, both for individuals and for organizations. 
The latej. C. Penney was quoted as saying that the wisest decision he ever made was to "let go" after 
realizing that he couldn't do it all by himself any longer. That decision, made long ago, enabled the 
development and growth of hundreds of stores and thousands of people. 

Because delegation involves other people, it is a Public Victory and could well be included in Habit 
4. But because we are focusing hereon principles of personal management, and the ability to delegate 
to others is the main difference between the role of manager and independent producer, I am 
approachi ng del egati on from the stand poi nt of your personal managerial ski 11 s. 

A producer does whatever is necessary to accomplish desired results, to get the golden eggs. A 
parent who washes the dishes, an architect who draws up blueprints, or a secretary who types 
correspondence is a producer. 

But when a person sets up and works with and through people and systems to produce golden eggs, 
that person becomes a manager in the interdependent sense. A parent who delegates washing the 
dishes to a child is a manager. An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager. A 
secretary who supervises other secretaries and office personnel is an office manager. 

A producer can invest one hour of effort and produce one unit of results, assuming no loss of 
efficiency. 

A manager, on the other hand, can invest one hour of effort and produce 10 or 50 or 100 units 
through effective del egati on. 

Management is essentially moving the fulcrum over, and the key to effective management is 
delegation. 

Gofer Delegation 

There are basically two kinds of delegation: "gofer delegation" and "stewardship delegation." Gofer 
delegation means "Go for this, go for that, do this, do that, and tell me when it's done." Most people 
who are producers have a gofer delegation paradigm. Remember the machete wielders in the jungle? 
They are the producers. Theyroll up their sleeves and get the job done. If they are given a position 
of supervision or management, they still think like producers. They don't know how to set up a full 
delegation so that another person is committed to achieve results. Because they are focused on 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


methods, they become responsible for the results. 

I was involved in a gofer delegation once when our family went water skiing. My son, who is an 
excellent skier, was in the water being pulled and I was driving the boat. I handed the camera to 
Sandra and asked her to take some pictures. 

Atfirst, I told her to be selective in her picture taking because wedidn't have much film left. Then I 
realized she was unfamiliar with the camera, so I became a little more specific. I told her to besureto 
wait until the sun was ahead of the boat and until our son was jumping the wake or making a turn and 
touching his el bow. 

But the more I thought about our limited footage and her inexperience with the camera, the more 
concerned I became. I finally said, "Look, Sandra, just push the button when I tell you. Okay? And 
I spent the next few minutes yelling, "Take it! -- Take it! -- Don't take it! -- Don't take it!" I was afraid 
that if I didn't direct her every moveevery second, it wouldn't bedone right. 

That was true gofer delegation, one-on-one supervision of methods. Many people consistently 
delegate that way. But how much does it really accomplish? And how many people is it possibleto 
supervise or manage when you have to be involved in every move they make? 

There's a much better way, a more effective way to delegate to other people. And it's based on a 
paradigm of appreciation of the self-awareness, the imagination, the conscience, and the free will of 
other people. 

Stewardship Delegation 

Stewardship delegation is focused on results instead of methods. It gives people a choice of 
method and makes them responsible for results. Ittakes more time in the beginning, but it's time well 
invested. You can move the fulcrum over, you can increase your leverage, through stewardship 
delegation. 

Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding 
expectati ons i n five areas. 

Desired Results: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing 
on what, not how; results, not methods. Spend time. Be patient. Visualize the desired result. 
Have the person see it, describe it, make out a quality statement of what the results will look like, and 
by when they will be accomplished. 

Guidelines: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate. These should be 
as few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions. You 
won't want a person to think he had considerable latitude as long as he accomplished the objectives, 
only to violate some long-standing traditional practice or value. That kills initiative and sends people 
back to the gofer's creed: "Just tel I me what you want me to do, and I'll doit." 

If you know the failure paths of the job, identify them. Be honest and open -- tell a person where 
the quicksand is and where the wild animals are. You don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every 
day. Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure 
paths, what not to do, but don't tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them -- 
to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines. 

Resources: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can 
draw on to accomplish the desired results. 

Accountability: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and 
the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. 

Consequences: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. This 
could include such things as financial rewards, psychic rewards, different job assignments, and natural 
consequences tied into the overall mission of an organization.

Some years ago, I had an interesting experience in delegation with one of my sons. We were 
having a family meeting, and we had our mission statement up on the wall to make sure our plans 
were in harmony with our values. Everybody was there. 

I set up a big blackboard and we wrote down our goals -- the key things we wanted to do -- and the 
jobs that flowed out of those goals. Then I asked for volunteers to do the job. 

"Who wants to pay the mortgage?" I asked. I noticed I wastheonly onewith my hand up. 

"Who wants to pay for the insurance? The food? The cars?" I seemed to have a real monopoly on 
the opportunities. 

"Who wants to feed the new baby?" There was more interest here, but my wife was the only one 
with the right qualifications for thejob. 

As we went down the list, job by job, it was soon evident that Mom and Dad had more than 
sixty-hour work weeks. With that paradigm in mind, some of the other jobs took on a more proper 
perspective. 

My seven-year-old son, Stephen, volunteered to take care of the yard. Before I actually gave him a 
job, I began a thorough training process. I wanted him to have a clear picture in his mind of what a 
well-cared-for yard was like, so I took him next door to our neighbor's. 

"Look, son," I said. "See how our neighbor's yard is green and clean? That's what we're after: green 
and clean. N ow come look at our yard. Seethe mixed colors? That's not it; that's not green. Green 
and clean is what we want. Now how you get it green is up to you. You're free to do it any way you 
want, except paint it. But I'll tell you how I'd do it if it were up to me." 

"How would you do it, Dad?" 

"I'd turn on the sprinklers. But you may want to use buckets or a hose. It makes no difference to 
me. All wecareabout is that the col or isgreen. Okay?" 

"Okay." 

"Now let's talk about 'clean,' Son. Clean means no messes around -- no paper, strings, bones, sticks, 
or anything that messes up the place. I'll tell you what let's do. Let's just clean up half of the yard 
right now and look at the difference." 

So we got out two paper sacks and picked up one side of the yard. "N ow look at this side. Look 
at the other side. See the difference? That's cal led clean." 

"Wait!" he called. "I seesome paper behind that bush!" 

"Oh, good! I didn't notice that newspaper back there. You havegood eyes, Son." 

"Now before you decide whether or not you're going to take thejob, let me tell you a few more 
things. Because when you take the job, I don't do it anymore. It'syourjob. It's called a stewardship. 
Stewardship means 'a job with a trust.' I trust you to do thejob, to get it done. Now who's going to be 
your boss?" 

"You, Dad?" 

"No, not me. You're the boss. You boss yourself. How do you like Mom and Dad nagging you 
all the time?" 

"I don't." 

"We don't like doing it either. It sometimes causes a bad feeling doesn't it? So you boss yourself. 
N ow, guess who your hel per is." 

"Who?" 

"I am," I said. "You boss me." 

"I do?" 

'That's right. But my time to help is limited. Sometimes I'm away. But when I'm here, you tell 
me how I can help. I'll do anything you want me to do." 

"Okay!" 

"Now guess who judges you." 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Heart 


"Who?" 

"You judge yourself." 

"I do?" 

'That's right. Twice a week the two of us will walk around the yard and you can show me how it's 
comi ng. How are you goi ng to judge?" 

"Green and clean." 

"Right!" 

I trained him with those two words for two weeks before I felt he was ready to take the job. Finally, 
the big day came. 

"Is it a deal, Son?" 

"It's a deal." 

"What's the job?" 

"Green and clean." 

"What's green?" 

He looked at our yard, which was beginning to look better. Then he pointed next door. 'That's 
the col or of his yard." 

"What's clean?" 

"No messes." 

"Who's the boss?" 

"I am." 

"Who's your helper?" 

"You are, when you have time." 

"Who's the judge?" 

"I am. We'll walk around two times a week and I can show you how it's coming." 

"And what will we look for?" 

"Green and clean." 

Atthattimel didn't mention an allowance. But I wouldn't hesitate to attach an allowance to such a 
stewardship. 

Two weeks and two words. I thought he was ready. 

It was Saturday. And he did nothing. Sunday...nothing. Monday...nothing. As I pulled out of 
the driveway on my way to work on Tuesday, I looked at the yellow, cluttered yard and the hot July 
sun on its way up. "Surely he'll do it today," I thought. I could rationalize Saturday because that was 
the day we made the agreement. I could rationalize Sunday; Sunday was for other things. But I 
couldn't rationalize Monday. And now it was Tuesday. Certainly he'd do it today. It was 
summertime. What else did he have to do? 

All day I could hardly wait to return home to see what happened. As I rounded the corner, I was 
met with the same picture I left that morning. And there was my son at the park across the street 
playing. 

This was not acceptable. I was upset and disillusioned by his performance after two weeks of 
training and all those commitments. We had a lot of effort, pride, and money invested in the yard and 
I could see it going down the drain. Besides, my neighbor's yard was manicured and beautiful, and 
the situation was beginning to get embarrassing. 

I was ready to go back to gofer delegation. Son, you get over here and pick up this garbage right 
now or else! I knew I could get the golden egg that way. But what about the goose? What would 
happen to his internal commitment? 

So I faked asmileand yelled across the street, "Hi, Son. How's itgoing?" 

"Fine!" he returned. 

"How's the yard coming?" I knew the minute I said it I had broken our agreement. That's not the 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


way we had set up an accounting. That's not what we had agreed. 

"How's the yard coming?" I knew the minute I said it I had broken our agreement. That's not the 
way we had set up an accounting. That's not what we had agreed. 

So hefeltjustified in breaking it, too. "Fine, Dad." 

I bit my tongue and waited until after dinner. Then I said, "Son, let's do as we agreed. Let's walk 
around the yard together and you can show me how it's going in your stewardship." 

Aswestarted outthedoor, hischin began to quiver. Tears welled up in hiseyesand, by the time 
we got out to the middle of the yard, he was whimperi ng. 

"It's so hard, Dad!" 

What's so hard? I thought to myself. You haven't done a single thing! But I knew what was 
hard -- self management, self-supervision. So I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?" 

"Would you, Dad?" he sniffed 

"What was our agreement?" 

"You said you'd help me if you had time." 

"I have time." 

So he ran into the house and came back with two sacks. He handed me one. "Will you pick that 
stuff up?" Hepointed to the garbage from Saturday night's barbecue. "It makes mesick!" 

So I did. I did exactly what he asked me to do. And that was when he signed the agreement in 
his heart. It became his yard, his stewardship. 

H e only asked for hel p two or three more ti mes that enti re summer. H e took care of that yard. H e 
kept it greener and cleaner than it had ever been under my stewardship. He even reprimanded his 
brothers and sisters if they left so much as a gum wrapper on the lawn. 

Trust is the highest form of human motivation. It brings out the very best in people. But it takes 
time and patience, and it doesn't preclude the necessity to train and develop people so that their 
competency can rise to the level of that trust. 

I am convinced that if stewardship delegation is done correctly, both parties will benefit and 
ultimately much more work will get done in much less time. I believe that a family that is well 
organized, whose time has been spent effectively delegating on a one-to-one basis, can organize the 
work so that everyone can do everything in about an hour a day. But that takes the internal capacity 
to want to manage, not just produce. Thefocus is on effectiveness, not efficiency. 

Certainly you can pick up that room better than achild, but the key isthatyou want to empower the 
child todoit. Ittakestime. You have to get involved in thetraining and development. Ittakestime, 
but how valuablethat time is downstream! It saves you so much in the long run. 

This approach involves an entirely new paradigm of delegation. In effect, it changes the nature of 
the relationship: The steward becomes his own boss, governed by a conscience that contains the 
commitment to agreed upon desired results. But it also releases his creative energies toward doing 
whatever is necessary in harmony with correct principles to achieve those desired results. 

The principles involved in stewardship delegation are correct and applicableto any kind of person 
or situation. With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify 
more resources, conduct more frequent accountability interviews, and apply more immediate 
consequences. With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, 
I ess frequent accountability, and less measurable but more discernible criteria. 

Effective delegation is perhaps the best indicator of effective management simply because it is so 
basic to both personal and organizational growth. 

The Quadrant 11 Paradigm 

The key to effective management of self, or of others through delegation, is not in any technique or 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

tool or extrinsic factor. It is intrinsic--in the Quadrant II paradigm that empowers you to see through 
the lens of i mportance rather than urgency. 

I have included in the Appendix an exercise called "A Quadrant II Day at the Office" which will 
enableyou to see in a business setting how powerfully this paradigm can impact your effectiveness. 

As you work to develop a Quadrant II paradigm, you will increase your ability to organize and 
execute every week of your life around your deepest priorities, to walk your talk. You will not be 
dependent on any other person or thing for the effective management of your life. 

Interestingly, every one of the Seven Habits is in Quadrant II. Every onedeals with fundamentally 
important things that, if done on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in our 
lives. 

Application Suggestions: 

1. Identify a Quadrant II activity you know has been neglected in your life--one that, if done well, 
would have a significant impact in your life, either personally or professionally. Write it down and 
commit to implement it. 

2. Draw a Time Management Matrix and try to estimate what percentage of your time you spend 
in each quadrant. Then log your time for three days in 15-minute intervals. How accurate was your 
estimate? Areyou satisfied with theway you spend yourtime? What do you need to change. 

3. Make a list of responsibilities you could delegate and the people you could delegate to or train 
to be responsible in these areas. Determine what is needed to start the process of delegation or 
training. 

4. Organize your next week. Start by writing down your roles and goals for the week, then 
transfer the goals to a specific action plan. At the end of the week, evaluate how well your plan 
translated your deep values and purposes into your daily life and the degree of integrity you were able 
to maintain to those values and purposes. 

5. Commit yourself to start organizing on a weekly basis and set up a regular time to do it. 

6. Either convert your current planning tool into a fourth generation tool or secure such a tool. 

7. Go through "A Quadrant II Day at the Office" (Appendix B) for a more in-depth understanding

Part Three 
Public Victory 

Paradigms of I nterdependence 


There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity 

- Samuel John so 

* * 

Before moving into the area of Public Victory, we should remember that effective interdependence 
can only be built on a foundation of true independence. Private Victory precedes Public Victory. 
Algebra comes before calculus. 

As we look back and survey the terrain to determine where we've been and where we are in 
relationship to where we're going, we clearly see that we could not have gotten where we are without 
comi ng the way we came. There aren't any other roads; there aren't any shortcuts. There's no way to 
parachute into this ter rain. The landscape ahead iscovered with thefragments of broken relationships 
of people who have tried. They've tried to jump into effective relationships without the maturity, the 
strength of character, to maintain them. 

But you just can't do it; you simply have to travel the road. You can't be successful with other 
people if you haven't paid the price of success with yourself. 

A few years ago when I was giving a seminar on the Oregon coast, a man came up to me and said, 
"You know, Stephen, I really don't enjoy coming to these seminars." Hehad my attention. 

"Look at everyone else here," he continued. "Look at this beautiful coastline and the sea out there 
and all that's happening. All I can do is sit and worry about the grilling I'm going to get from my wife 
tonight on the phone. 

"She gives me the third degree every time I'm away. Where did I eat breakfast? Who else was 
there? Was I in meetings all morning? When did we stop for lunch? What did I do during lunch? 
How did I spend the afternoon? What did I do for entertainment in the evening? Who was with me? 
What did we talk about? 

"And what she really wants to know, but never quite asks, is who she can call to verify everything I 
tell her. Shejust nags me and questions everything I do whenever I'm away. It's taken the bloom out 
of this whole experience. I really don't enjoy it at all." 

Hedid look pretty miserable. We talked for awhile, and then hemadea very interesting comment. 
"I guess she knows all the questions to ask," he said a little sheepishly. "It was at a seminar like this 
that I met her when I was married to someone else!" 

I considered the implications of his comment and then said, "You're kind of into 'quick fix,' aren't 
you?" 

"What do you mean?" he replied. 

"Well, you'd I ike to take a screwdriver and just open up your wife's head and rewire that attitude of 
hers really fast, wouldn't you?" 

"Sure, I'd likeher to change," he exclaimed. "I don'tthink it's rightfor her to constantly grill melike 
she does." 

"Myfriend,"l said, "you can'ttalkyour way out of problems you behave yourself into." 

We're dealing with a very dramatic and very fundamental Paradigm Shift here. You may try to 
lubricate your social interactions with personality techniques and skills, but in the process, you may 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


truncate the vital character base. You can't have the fruits without the roots. It's the principle of 
sequencing: Private Victory precedes Public Victory. Self-mastery and self-discipline are the 
foundation of good relationships with others. 

Some people say that you have to like yourself before you can like others. I think that idea has 
merit, but if you don't know yourself, if you don't control yourself, if you don't have mastery over 
yourself, it's very hard to I ike yourself, except in some short-term, psych-up, superficial way. 

Real self-respect comes from dominion over self, from true independence. And that's the focus of 
Habits 1, 2, and 3. Independence is an achievement. Interdependence is a choice only independent 
people can make. Unless we are willing to achieve real independence, it's foolish to try to develop 
human-relations skills. We might try. We might even have some degree of success when the sun is 
shining. But when the difficult times come -- and they will -- we won't have the foundation to keep 
things together. 

The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but 
what we are. And if our words and our actions come from superficial human-relations techniques (the 
personality ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the character ethic), others will sense that 
duplicity. We simply won't be able to create and sustain the foundation necessary for effective 
interdependence. 

The techniques and skil Is that really make a difference in human interaction are the ones that al most 
naturally flow from a truly independent character. So the place to begin building any relationship is 
inside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influence, our own character. As we become independent -- 
proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organize and execute around the 
priorities in our life with integrity -- we then can choose to become interdependent -- capable of 
building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people. 

As we look at the terrain ahead, we see that we're entering a whole new dimension. 
Interdependence opens up worlds of possibilities for deep, rich, meaningful associations, for 
geometrically increased productivity, for serving, for contributing, for learning, for growing. But it is 
also where we feel the greatest pain, the greatest frustration, the greatest roadblocks to happiness and 
success. A nd we're very aware of that pai n because it i s acute. 

We can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, leadership or management in 
our personal I ives. We feel vaguely uneasy and uncomfortable and occasional ly take steps to ease the 
pain, at I east for a time. But the pain ischronic, weget used to it, welearn to livewith it. 

But when we have problems in our interactions with other people, we're very aware of acute pain -- 
it's often intense, and we want it to go away. 

That's when we try to treat the symptoms with quick fixes and techniques -- the band-aids of the 
personality ethic. We don't understand that the acute pain is an outgrowth of the deeper, chronic 
problem. And until we stop treating the symptoms and start treating the problem, our efforts will 
only bring counterproductive results. We will only be successful at obscuring the chronic pain even 
more. 

Now, as we think of effective interaction with others, let's go back to our earlier definition of 
effectiveness. We've said it's the P/ PC Balance, the fundamental concept in the story of the Goose and 
the Golden Egg. 

In an interdependent situation, the golden eggs are the effectiveness, the wonderful synergy, the 
results created by open communication and positive interaction with others. And to get those eggs on 
a regular basis, we need to take care of the goose. We need to create and care for the relationships that 
makethose results realities. 

So before we descend from our point of reconnaissance and get into Habits 4, 5, and 6,1 would like 
to introduce what I believe to be a very powerful metaphor in describing relationships and in defining 
the P/ PC Balance in an interdependent reality.

The Emotional Bank AccountTM 

We all know what a financial bank account is. We make deposits into it and build up a reserve 
from which we can make withdrawals when we need to. An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor 
that describes the amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship. It's the feeling of safeness you 
havewith another human being. 

If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, 
and keeping my commitments to you, I build up a reserve. Your trust toward me becomes higher, and 
I can call upon that trust many times if I need to. I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that 
emotional reserve, will compensate for it. My communication may not be clear, but you'll get my 
meaning anyway. You won't make me "an offender for a word." When the trust account is high, 
communication is easy, instant, and effective. 

But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disrespect, cutting you off, overreacting, ignoring you, 
becoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or playing little tin god in your life, 
eventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn. The trust level gets very low. Then what 
flexibility do I have? 

None. I'm walking on minefields. I haveto be very careful of everything I say. I measureevery 
word. It's tension city, memo heaven. It's protecting my backside, politicking. And many 
organizations are filled with it. Many families are filled with it. Many marriages are filled with it. 

If a large reserve of trust is not sustained by continuing deposits, a marriage will deteriorate. 
Instead of rich, spontaneous understanding and communication, the situation becomes one of 
accommodation, where two people simply attempt to live independent life-styles in a fairly respectful 
and tolerant way. The relationship may further deteriorate to one of hostility and defensiveness. The 
"fight or flight" response creates verbal battles, slammed doors, refusal to talk, emotional withdrawal 
and self-pity. It may end up in a cold war at home, sustained only by children, sex, and social pressure, 
or image protection. Or it may end up in open warfare in the courts, where bitter ego-decimating legal 
battles can be carried on for years as people endlessly confess the sins of a former spouse. 

And this is in the most intimate, the most potentially rich, joyful, satisfying and productive 
relationship possible between two people on this earth. The P/ PC lighthouse is there; we can either 
break ourselves against it or we can use it as a guidi ng I ight. 

Our most constant relationships, like marriage, require our most constant deposits. With 
continuing expectations, old deposits evaporate. If you suddenly run into an old high school friend 
you haven't seen for years, you can pick up right where you left off because the earlier deposits are still 
there. But your accounts with the people you interact with on a regular basis require more constant 
investment. There are sometimes automatic withdrawals in your daily interactions or in their 
perception of you that you don't even know about. This is especially true with teenagers in the home. 

Suppose you have a teenage son and your normal conversation is something like, "Clean your room. 
Button your shirt. Turn down the radio. Go get a haircut. And don't forget to take out the 
garbage!" Over a period of time, the withdrawals far exceed the deposits. 

Now, suppose this son is in the process of making some important decisions that will affect the rest 
of his life. But the trust level is so low and the communication process so closed, mechanical, and 
unsatisfying that he simply will not be open to your counsel. You may have the wisdom and the 
knowledge to help him, but because your account is so overdrawn, he will end up making his decisions 
from a short-range emotional perspective, which may well result in many negative long-range 
consequences. 

You need a positive balance to communicate on these tender issues. What do you do? 

What would happen if you started making deposits into the relationship? Maybe the opportunity 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


comes up to do him a little kindness-- to bring home a magazine on skateboarding, if that's his interest, 
or just to walk up to him when he's working on a project and offer help. Perhaps you could invite him 
to go to a movie with you or take him out for some ice cream. Probably the most important deposit 
you could make would be just to listen, without judging or preaching or reading your own 
autobiography into what he says. Just listen and seek to understand. Let him feel your concern for 
him, your acceptance of hi m as a person. 

He may not respond at first. He may even be suspicious. "What's Dad up to now? What 
technique is Mom trying on me this time?" But as those genuine deposits keep coming, they begin to 
add up. That overdrawn balance is shrinking. 

Remember that quick fix is a mirage. Building and repairing relationships takes time. If you 
become impatient with this apparent lack of response of his seeming ingratitude, you may make huge 
withdrawals and undo all the good you've done. "After all we've done for you, the sacrifices we've 
made, how can you be so ungrateful? Wetry to be nice and you act likethis. I can't believe it! 

It's hard not to get i mpatient. It takes character to be proactive, to focus on your Circle of I nfluence, 
to nurture growing things, and not to "pull up the flowers to see how the roots are coming." 

But there really is no quick fix. Building and repairing relationships are long-term investments. 

Six Major Deposits 

Let me suggest six major deposits that build the Emotional Bank Account 

Understanding the Individual 

Really seeking to understand another person is probably one of the most important deposits you can 
make, and it is the key to every other deposit. You simply don't know what constitutes a deposit to 
another person until you understand that individual. What might be a deposit for you -- going for a 
walk to talk things over, going out for icecream together, working on a common project -- might not be 
perceived by someone else as a deposit at all. It might even be perceived as a withdrawal, if it doesn't 
touch the person's deep interests or needs. 

One person's mission isanother person's minutia. To make a deposit, what is important to another 
person must be as important to you as the other person is to you. You may be working on a high 
priority project when your six-year-old child interrupts with something that seems trivial to you, but it 
may be very i mportant from his point of view. Ittakes Habit2to recognize and recommit yourself to 
the value of that person and Habit 3 to subordinate your schedule to that human priority. By 
accepting the value he places on what he has to say, you show an understanding of him that makes a 
great deposit. 

I have a friend whose son developed an avid interest in baseball. My friend wasn't interested in 
basebal I at al I. But one summer, he took his son to see every major league team play one game. The 
trip took over six weeks and cost a great deal of money, but it became a powerful bonding experience in 
their relationship. 

My friend was asked on his return, "Do you I ike basebal I that much?" 

"No," he replied, "but I like my son that much." 

I have another friend, a college professor, who had a terrible relationship with his teenage son. 
This man's entire life was essentially academic, and he felt his son was totally wasting his life by 
working with this hands instead of working to develop his mind. As a result, he was almost 
constantly on the boy's back, and, in moments of regret, he would try to make deposits that just didn't 
work. The boy perceived the gestures as new forms of rejection, comparison, and judgment, and they 
precipitated huge withdrawals. The relationship was turning sour, and it was breaking the father's 
heart. 

One day I shared with him this principle of making what is important to the other person as 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


important to you as the other person is to you. He took it deeply to heart. He engaged his son in a 
project to build a miniature Wall of China around their home. It was a consuming project, and they 
worked side by side on it for over a year and a half. 

Through that bonding experience, the son moved through that phase in his life and into an increased 
desire to develop his mind. But the real benefit was what happened to the relationship. Instead of a 
sore spot, it became a source of joy and strength to both father and son. 

Our tendency is to project out of our own autobiographies what wethink other people want or need. 
We project our intentions on the behavior of others. We interpret what constitutes a deposit based on 
our own needs and desires, either now or when we were at a similar age or stage in life. If they don't 
interpret our effort as a deposit, our tendency is to take it as a rejection of our well-intentioned effort 
and give up. 

The Golden Rule says to "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." While on the 
surface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more 
essential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be 
understood, and then to treat them in terms of that understanding. As one successful parent said 
about raising children, "Treat them all the same by treati ng them differently." 

Attending to the LittleThings 

The little kindnesses and courtesies are so important. Small discourtesies, little unkindnesses, little 
forms of d i srespect make I arge wi thd rawal s. I n rel ati onshi ps, the I ittle thi ngs are the bi g thi ngs. 

I remember an evening I spent with two of my sons some years ago. It was an organized 
father-and-son outing, complete with gymnastics, wrestling matches, hot dogs, orangeade, and a movie 
-- the works. 

In the middle of the movie, Sean, who was then four years old, fell asleep in his seat. His older 
brother, Stephen, who was six, stayed awake, and we watched the rest of the movie together. When it 
was over, I picked Sean up in my arms, carried him out to the car and laid him in the back seat. It was 
very cold that night, so I took off my coat and gently arranged it over and around him. 

When we arrived home, I quickly carried Sean in and tucked him into bed. After Stephen put on 
his "jammies" and brushed histeeth, I laydown next to him to talk about the night out together. 

"How'd you like it, Stephen?" 

"Fine," heanswere" 

"Did you have fun?" 

"Yes." 

"What did you like most?" 

"I don't know. The trampoline, I guess." 

'That was quite a thing, wasn't it-- doing those somersaults and tricks in the air I ike that?" 

There wasn't much response on his part. I found myself making conversation. I wondered why 
Stephen wouldn't open up more. He usually did when exciting things happened. I was a little 
disappointed. I sensed something was wrong; he had been so quiet on the way home and getting 
ready for bed. 

Suddenly Stephen turned over on his side, facing the wall. I wondered why and lifted myself up 
just enough to see his eyes welling up with tears. 

"What's wrong, honey? What is it?" 

He turned back, and I could sense he was feeling some embarrassment for the tears and his 
quivering lips and chin 

"Daddy, if I were cold, would you put your coat around me too?" 

Of all the events of that special night out together, the most i mportant was a little act of kindness -- a 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


momentary, unconscious showing of love to his little brother. 

Whata powerful, personal lesson that experience was to me then and iseven now. Peoplearevery 
tender, very sensitive inside. I don't believe age or experience makes much difference. Inside, even 
within the most toughened and calloused exteriors, are the tender feelings and emotions of the heart. 

Keeping Commitments 

Keeping a commitment or a promise is a major deposit; breaking one is a major withdrawal. In fact, 
there's probably not a more massive withdrawal than to make a promise that's important to someone 
and then not to come through. The next time a promise is made, they won't believe it. Peopletendto 
build their hopes around promises, particularly promises about their basic livelihood. 

I've tried to adopt a philosophy as a parent never to makea promise I don't keep. I therefore try to 
make them very carefully, very sparingly, and to be aware of as many variables and contingencies as 
possible so that something doesn't suddenly comeupto keep me from fulfilling it. 

Occasionally, despite all my effort, the unexpected does come up, creating a situation where it 
would be unwise or impossibleto keep a promise I've made. But I valuethat promise. I either keep it 
anyway, or explain the situation thoroughly to the person involved and ask to be released from the 
promise. 

I believe that if you cultivate the habit of always keeping the promises you make, you build bridges 
of trust that span the gaps of understanding between you and your child. Then, when your child 
wants to do something you don't want him to do, and out of your maturity you can see consequences 
that the child cannot see, you can say, "Son, if you do this, I promise you that this will be the result." If 
that child has cultivated trust in your word, in your promises, he will acton your counsel. 

Clarifying Expectations 

Imagine the difficulty you might encounter if you and your boss had different assumptions 
regarding whose role it was to create your job description. 

"When am I going to get my job description?" you might ask. 

"I've been waiting for you to bring one to me so that we could discuss it," your boss might reply. 

"I thought defining my job was your role." 

'That's not my role at all. Don't you remember? Right from the first, I said that how you do in the 
job largely depends on you." 

"I thought you meant that the quality of my job depended on me. But I don't even know what my 
job really is." 

"I did exactly what you asked metodoand here is the report." 

"I don't want a report. The goals was to solve the problem--not to analyze it and report on it." 

"I thought the goal was to get a handle on the problem so we could delegate it to someone else." 

How many times have we had these kinds of conversations? 

"You said..." 

"No, you're wrong! I said..." 

"You did not! You never said I was supposed to..." 

"Oh, yes I did! I clearly said..." 

"You never even mentioned..." 

"But that was our agreement..." 

The cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations 
around roles and goals. Whether we are dealing with the question of who does what at work, how 
you communicate with your daughter when you tell her to clean her room, or who feeds the fish and 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

takes out the garbage, we can be certain that unclear expectations will lead to misunderstanding, 
disappointment, and withdrawals of trust. 

Many expectations are implicit. They haven't been explicitly stated or announced, but people 
nevertheless bring them to a particular situation. In marriage, for example, a man and a woman have 
implicit expectations of each other in their marriage roles. Although these expectations have not been 
discussed, or sometimes even recognized by the person who has them, fulfilling them makes great 
deposits in the relationship and violating them makes withdrawals. 

That's why it's so important whenever you come into a new situation to get all the expectations out 
onthetable. Peoplewill begin to judge each other through those expectations. And iftheyfeel like 
their basic expectations have been violated, the reserve of trust is diminished. We create many 
negative situations by simply assuming that our expectations are self-evident and that they are clearly 
understood and shared by other people. 

The deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning. This takes a real 
investment of time and effort up front, but it saves great amounts of time and effort down the road. 
When expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple 
misunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication 
breakdowns. 

Clarifying expectations sometimes takes a great deal of courage. It seems easier to act as though 
differences don't exist and to hope things will work out than it is to face the differences and work 
together to arrive at a mutually agreeable set of expectations. 

Showing Personal Integrity 

Personal integrity generates trust and is the basis of many different kinds of deposits. 

Lack of integrity can undermine almost any other effort to create high trust accounts. People can 
seek to understand, remember the littlethings, keep their promises, clarify and fulfill expectations, and 
still fail to build reserves of trust if they are inwardly duplicitous. 

Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty. Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, 
conforming our words to reality. Integrity is conforming reality to our words -- in other words, 
keeping promises and fulfilling expectations. This requires an integrated character, a oneness, 
primarily with self but also with life. 

One of the most i mportant ways to manifest i ntegrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. I n 
doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you 
retain the trust of those present. 

Suppose you and I were talking alone, and we were criticizing our supervisor in a way that we 
would not dare to if he were present. Now what will happen when you and I have a falling out? You 
know I'm going to be discussing your weaknesses with someone else. That's what you and I did 
behind our supervisor's back. You know my nature. I'll sweet-talk you to your face and bad-mouth 
you behind your back. You've seen me do it. 

That's the essence of duplicity. Does that build a reserve of trust in my account with you. 

On the other hand, suppose you were to start criticizing our supervisor and I basically told you I 
agree with the content of some of the criticism and suggest that the two of us go directly to him and 
make an effective presentation of how things might be improved. Then what would you know I 
would do if someone were to criticize you to me behind your back? 

For another example, suppose in my effort to build a relationship with you, I told you something 
someone else had shared with me in confidence. "I really shouldn't tell you this," I might say, "but 
since you're my friend..." Would my betraying another person build my trust account with you? Or 
would you wonder if the things you had told mein confidence were being shared with others?

Such duplicity might appear to be making a deposit with the person you're with, but it is actually a 
withdrawal because you communicate your own lack of integrity. You may get the golden egg of 
temporary pleasure from putting someone down or sharing privileged information, but you're 
strangling the goose, weakening the relationship that provides enduring pleasure in association. 

Integrity in an interdependent reality is simply this: you treat everyone by the same set of principles. 
As you do, people will come to trust you. They may not at first appreciate the honest confrontational 
experiences such integrity might generate. Confrontation takes considerable courage, and many 
people would prefer to take the course of least resistance, belittling and criticizing, betraying 
confidences, or participating in gossip about others behind their backs. But in the long run, people 
will trust and respect you if you are honest and open and kind with them. You care enough to 
confront. And to be trusted, it is said, is greater than to be loved. In the long run, I am convinced, to 
be trusted will be also mean to beloved. 

When my son Joshua was quite young, he would frequently ask me a soul-searching question. 
Whenever I overreacted to someone else or was the least bit impatient or unkind, he was so vulnerable 
and so honest and our relationship was so good that he would simply look mein the eye and say, "Dad, 
do you love me?" If he thought I was breaking a basic principle of life toward someone else, he 
wondered if I wouldn't break it with him. 

Asateacher, as well asa parent, I have found that the key to the ninety-nine is the one-- particularly 
the one that is testing the patience and the good humor of the many. It is the love and the discipline of 
the one student, the one child, that communicates love for the others. It's how you treat the one that 
reveals how you regard the ninety-nine, because everyone is ultimately a one. 

Integrity also means avoiding any communication that is deceptive, full of guile, or beneath the 
dignity of people. "A lie is any communication with intent to deceive," according to one definition of 
the word. Whether we communicate with words or behavior, if we have integrity, our intent cannot 
be to deceive. 

Apologizing Sincerely When You Make a Withdrawal 

When we make withdrawals from the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need 
to do it sincerely. Great deposits come in the sincere words 

"I was wrong." 

'That was unkind of me." 

"I showed you no respect." 

"I gave you no dignity, and I'm deeply sorry." 

"I embarrassed you in front of your friends and I had no call to do that. Even though I wanted to 
makea point, I never should havedoneit. I apologize." 

It takes a great deal of character strength to apologize quickly out of one's heart rather than out of 
pity. A person must possess himself and have a deep sense of security in fundamental principles and 
values in order to genuinely apologize. 

People with little internal security can't do it. It makes them too vulnerable. They feel it makes 
them appear soft and weak, and they fear that others will take advantage of their weakness. Their 
security is based on the opinions of other people, and they worry about what others might think. In 
addition, they usually feel justified in what they did. They rationalize their own wrong in the name of 
the other person's wrong, and if they apologize at all, it's superficial. 

"If you're going to bow, bow low," say Eastern wisdom. "Pay the uttermost farthing," says the 
Christian ethic. To bea deposit, an apology must besincere. And it must be perceived as sincere. 

Leo Roskin taught, "It isthe weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.

I was in my office at home one afternoon writing, of all things, on the subject of patience. I could 
hear the boys running up and down the hall making loud banging noises, and I could feel my own 
patience beginning to wane. 

Suddenly, my son David started pounding on the bathroom door, yelling at the top of his lungs, "Let 
mein! Let mein!" 

I rushed out of the office and spoke to him with great intensity. "David, do you have any idea how 
disturbing that is to me? Do you know how hard it is to try to concentrate and write creatively? N ow 
you go into your room and stay in there until you can behave yourself." So in he went, dejected, and 
shut the door. 

As I turned around, I became aware of another problem. The boys had been playing tackle football 
in the four-foot-wide hallway, and one of them had been elbowed in the mouth. He was lying there in 
the hall, bleeding from the mouth. David, I discovered, had gone to the bathroom to get a wet towel 
for him. But his sister, Maria, who was taking a shower, wouldn't open the door. 

When I realized that I had completely misinterpreted the situation and had overreacted, I 
immediately went in to apologizeto David. 

As I opened thedoor, the first thing he said to mewas, "I won't forgive you." 

"Well, why not, honey?" I replied. "Honestly, I didn't realize you were trying to help your brother. 
Why won't you forgive me?" 

"Because you did the same thing last week," he replied. In other words, he was saying. "Dad, 
you're overdrawn, and you're not going to talk your way out of a problem you behaved yourself into." 

Sincere apologies make deposits; repeated apologies interpreted as insincere make withdrawals. 
And the quality of the relationship reflects it. 

It is one thing to make a mistake, and quite another thing not to admit it. People will forgive 
mistakes, because mistakes are usually of the mind, mistakes of judgment. But people will not easily 
forgive the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, the bad motives, the prideful justifying cover-up of 
thefi rst mistake. 

The Laws of Love and the Laws of Life 

When we make deposits of unconditional love, when we live the primary laws of love, we 
encourage others to live the primary laws of life. In other words, when we truly love others without 
condition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their 
essential worth, identity, and integrity. Their natural growth process is encouraged. We make it 
easier for them to live the laws of life -- cooperation, contribution, self-discipline, integrity -- and to 
discover and live true to the highest and best within them. We give them the freedom to act on their 
own inner imperatives rather than react to our conditions and limitations. This does not mean we 
become permissive or soft. That itself is a massive withdrawal. We counsel, we plead, we set limits 
and consequences. But we love, regardless. 

When weviolatethe primary laws of love-- when weattach strings and conditions to that gift-- we 
actually encourage others to violate the primary laws of life. We put them in a reactive, defensive 
position where they feel they have to prove "I matter as a person, independent of you." 

In reality, they aren't independent. They are counter-dependent, which is another form of 
dependency and is at the lowest end of the Maturity Continuum. They become reactive, almost 
enemy-centered, more concerned about defending their "rights" and producing evidence of their 
individuality than they are about proactively listening to and honoring their own inner imperatives. 

Rebellion isa knot of the heart, not of the mind. Thekey isto make deposits-- constant deposits of 
unconditional love.

I once had a friend who was dean of a very prestigious school. He planned and saved for years to 
provide his son the opportunity to attend that institution, but when the time came, the boy refused to 
go. 

This deeply concerned his father. Graduating from that particular school would have been a great 
asset to the boy. Besides, it was a fami ly tradition. Three generations of attendance preceded the boy. 
Thefather pleaded and urged and talked. Healso tried to listen to the boy to understand him, all the 
whilehoping that the son would change his mind. 

The subtle message being communicated was one of conditional love. The son felt that in a sense 
the father's desire for him to attend the school outweighed the value he placed on him as a person and 
as a son, which was terribly threatening. Consequently, he fought for and with his own identity and 
integrity, and he increased his resolve and his efforts to rationalize his decision not to go. 

After some intense soul-searching, the father decided to make a sacrifice -- to renounce conditional 
love. He knew that his son might choose differently than he had wished; nevertheless, he and his wife 
resolved to love their son unconditionally, regardless of his choice. It was an extremely difficult thing 
to do because the value of his educational experience was so close to their hearts and because it was 
something they had planned and worked for since his birth. 

The father and mother went through a very difficult rescripting process, struggling to really 
understand the nature of unconditional love. They communicated to the boy what they were doing 
and why, and told him that they had come to the point at which they could say in all honesty that his 
decision would not affect their complete feeling of unconditional love toward him. They didn't do this 
to manipulate him, to try to get him to "shape up." They did it as the logical extension of their growth 
and character. 

The boy didn't give much of a response at the time, but his parents had such a paradigm of 
unconditional love at that point that it would have made no difference in their feelings for him. About 
a week later, he told his parents that he had decided not to go. They were perfectly prepared for his 
response and continued to show unconditional love for him. Everything was settled and life went 
along normally. 

A short time later, an interesting thing happened. Now that the boy no longer felt he had to defend 
his position, he searched within himself more deeply and found that he really did want to have this 
educational experience. He applied for admission, and then he told his father, who again showed 
unconditional love by fully accepting his son's decision. My friend was happy, but not excessively so, 
because he had truly learned to love without condition. 

Dag Hammarskjold, past Secretary-General of the United Nations, once made a profound, 
far-reaching statement: "It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor 
di I i gentl y for the sal vati on of the masses." 

I take that to mean that I could devote eight, ten, or twelve hours a day, five, six, or seven days a 
week to the thousands of people and projects "out there" and still not have a deep, meaningful 
relationship with my own spouse, with my own teenage son, with my closest working associate. And 
it would take more nobility of character -- more humility, courage, and strength -- to rebuild that one 
relationship than itwould to continue putting in all those hours for all those people and causes. 

In 25 years of consulting with organizations, I have been impressed over and over again by the 
power of that statement. Many of the problems in organizations stem from relationship difficulties at 
the very top -- between two partners in a company, between the president and an executive 
vice-president. It truly takes more nobility of character to confront and resolve those issues than it 
does to conti nue to di I igently work for the many projects and people "out there." 

When I first came across Hammarskjold's statement, I was working in an organization where there 
were unclear expectations between the individual who was my right-hand man and myself. I simply 
did not have the courage to confront our differences regarding role and goal expectations and values, 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


particularly in our methods of administration. So I worked for a number of months in a compromise 
mode to avoid what might turn out to be an ugly confrontation. All the while, bad feelings were 
developing inside both of us. 

After reading that it is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor 
diligently for the salvation of the masses, I was deeply affected by the idea of rebuilding that 
relationship. 

I had to steel myself for what lay ahead, because I knew it would be hard to really get the issues out 
and to achieve a deep, common understanding and commitment. I remember actually shaking in 
anticipation of the visit. He seemed like such a hard man, so set in his own ways and so right in his 
own eyes; yet I needed his strengths and abilities. I was afraid a confrontation might jeopardize the 
relationship and result in my losing those strengths. 

I went through a mental dress rehearsal of the anticipated visit, and I finally became settled within 
myself around the principles rather than the practices of what I was going to do and say. At last I felt 
peace of mind and the courage to have the communication. 

When we met together, to my total surprise, I discovered that this man had been going through the 
very same process and had been longing for such a conversation. He was anything but hard and 
defensive. 

Nevertheless, our administrative styles were considerably different, and the entire organization was 
responding to these differences. We both acknowledged the problems that our disunity had created. 
Over several visits, we were able to confront the deeper issues, to get them all out on the table, and to 
resolve them, one by one, with a spirit of high mutual respect. We were able to develop a powerful 
complementary team and a deep personal affection which added tremendously to our ability to work 
effectively together. 

Creating the unity necessary to run an effective business or a family or a marriage requires great 
personal strength and courage. N o amount of technical administrative skill in laboring for the masses 
can make up for lack of nobility of personal character in developing relationships. It is at a very 
essential, one-on-one Ievel, that we I i ve the pri mary Iaws of Iove and I ife. 

P Problems are PC 0 pportunities 

This experience also taught me another powerful paradigm of interdependence. It deals with the 
way in which we see problems. I had lived for months trying to avoid the problem, seeing it as a 
source of irritation, a stumbling block, and wishing it would somehow go away. But, as it turned out, 
the very problem created the opportunity to build a deep relationship that empowered us to work 
together as a strong complementary team. 

I suggest that in an interdependent situation, every P problem is a PC opportunity -- a chance to 
build the Emotional Bank Accounts that significantly affect interdependent production. 

When parents see their children's problems as opportunities to build the relationship instead of as 
negative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of parent-child interaction. Parents 
become more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children. When a 
child comes to them with a problem, instead of thinking, "Oh, no! Not another problem!" their 
paradigm is, "Here is a great opportunity for me to really help my child and to invest in our 
relationship." Many interactions change from transactional to transformational, and strong bonds of 
love and trust are created as children sense the value parents give to their problems and to them as 
individuals. 

This paradigm is powerful in business as well. One department store chain that operates from this 
paradigm has created a great loyalty among its customers. Any time a customer comes into the store 
with a problem, not matter how small, the clerks immediately see it as an opportunity to build the 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brwcft toyu tyH^Hairt 


relationship with the customer. They respond with a cheerful, positive desire to solve the problem in a 
way that will make the customer happy. They treat the customer with such grace and respect, giving 
such second-mile service, that many of the customers don't even think of going anywhere else. 

By recognizing that the P/ PC Balance is necessary to effectiveness in an interdependent reality, we 
can value our problems as opportunities to increase PC. 

The Habits of Interdependence 

With the paradigm of the Emotional Bank Account in mind, we're ready to move into the habits of 
Public Victory, or success in working with other people. As we do, we can see how these habits work 
together to create effective interdependence. We can also see how powerful ly scripted we are in other 
patterns of thought and behavior. 

In addition, we can see on an even deeper level that effective interdependence can only be achieved 
by truly independent people. It is impossible to achieve Public Victory with popular "Win-Win 
negotiation" techniques of "reflective listening" techniques or "creative problem-solving" techniques that 
focus on personality and truncate the vital character base. 

Let's now focus on each of the Public Victory habits in depth. 

Habit4: Think Win-Win TM - Principles of Interpersonal Leadership 

We have committed the Golden Ruleto memory; let us now commit it to life. 

- Edwin M arkha 

* * 

Onetime I was asked to work with a company whose president was very concerned about the lack 
of cooperation among his people. 

"Our basic problem, Stephen, is that they're selfish," he said. 'They just won't cooperate. I know if 
they would cooperate, we could produce so much more. Can you help us develop a human-relations 
program that will solve the problem?" 

"Is your problem the people or the paradigm?" I asked. 

"Look for yourself," he replied. 

So I did. And I found that there was a real selfishness, and unwillingness to cooperate, a resistance 
to authority, defensive communication. I could see that overdrawn Emotional Bank Accounts had 
created a culture of low trust. But I pressed the question. 

"Let's look at it deeper," I suggested. "Why don't your people cooperate? What is the reward for 
not cooperati ng?" 

'There's no reward for not cooperating," he assured me. "The rewards are much greater if they do 
cooperate. 

"Are they?" I asked. Behind a curtain on one wall of this man's office was a chart. On the chart 
were a number of racehorses all lined up on a track. Superimposed on the face of each horse was the 
face of one of his managers. Attheend of the track was a beautiful travel poster of Bermuda, an idyllic 
picture of blue skies and fleecy clouds and a romantic couple walking hand in hand down a white 
sandy beach. 

Once a week, this man would bring all his people into this office and talk cooperation. "Let's all 
work together. We'll all make more money if wedo." Then hewould pull thecurtain and show them 
thechart. "Now which of you isgoingto win thetrip to Bermuda?" 

It was like telling one flower to grow and watering another, like saying "firings will continue until 
morale improves." He wanted cooperation. Hewanted his peopleto work together, to share ideas, to 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

all benefit from the effort. But he was setting them up in competition with each other. One 
manager's success meant failure for the other managers 

As with many, many problems between people in business, family, and other relationships, the 
problem in this company was the result of a flawed paradigm. The president was trying to get the 
fruits of cooperation from a paradigm of competition. And when it didn't work, he wanted a 
technique, a program, a quick-fix antidote to make his people cooperate. 

But you can't change the fruit without changing the root. Working on the attitudes and behaviors 
would have been hacking at the leaves. So we focused instead on producing personal and 
organizational excellence in an entirely different way by developing information and reward systems 
which reinforced the value of cooperation. 

Whether you are the president of a company or the janitor, the moment you step from i ndependence 
into interdependence in any capacity, you step into a leadership role. You are in a position of 
influencing other people. And the habit of effective interpersonal leadership is Think Win-Win. 

Six Paradigms of H uman I nteraction 

Win-win is not a technique; it's a total philosophy of human interaction. In fact, it is one of six 
paradigms of interaction. The alternative paradigms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and 
Win-Win or No Deal TM 

Win-Win 

Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. 
Win-win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a 
win-win solution, all parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. 
Win-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Most people tend to think in terms of 
dichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball, win or lose. But that kind of thinking if 
fundamentally flawed. It's based on power and position rather than on principle. Win-win is based 
on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person's success is not achieved at the 
expense or exclusion of the success of others. 

Win-win is a belief in theThird Alternative. It's not your way or my way; it's a better way, a higher 
way. 

Win-Lose 

One alternative to win-win is win-lose, the paradigm of the race to Bermuda. It says "If I win, you 
lose. 

In leadership style, win-lose is the authoritarian approach: "I get my way; you don't get yours." 
Win-lose people are prone to use position, power, credentials, possessions, or personality to get their 
way. 

Most people have been deeply scripted in the win-lose mentality since birth. First and most 
important of the powerful forces at work is the family. When one child is compared with another -- 
when patience, understanding or love is given or withdrawn on the basis of such comparisons -- people 
are into win-lose thinking. Whenever love is given on a conditional basis, when someone has to earn 
love, what's being communicated to them is that they are not intrinsically valuable or lovable. Value 
does not lie inside them, it lies outside. It's in comparison with somebody else or against some 
expectation. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyR^Hairt 


And what happens to a young mind and heart, highly vulnerable, highly dependent upon the 
support and emotional affirmation of the parents, in the face of conditional love? The child is molded, 
shaped, and programmed in the win-lose mentality. 

"If I'm better than my brother, my parents will love me more." 

"My parents don't love me as much as they love my sister. I must not be as valuable." 

Another powerful scripting agency is the peer group. A child first wants acceptance from his 
parents and then from his peers, whether they be siblings or friends. And we all know how cruel 
peers sometimes can be. They often accept or reject totally on the basis of conformity to their 
expectations and norms, providing additional scripting toward win-lose. 

The academic world reinforces win-lose scripting. The "normal distribution curve" basically says 
that you got an "A" because someone else got a "C." It interprets an individual's value by comparing 
him or her to everyone else. No recognition is given to intrinsic value; everyone is extrinsically 
defined. 

"Oh, how nice to see you here at our PTA meeting. You ought to be really proud of your daughter, 
Caroline. She's in the upper 10 percent." 

'That makes me feel good." 

"But your son, Johnny, is in trouble. He's in the lower quartile." 

"Really? Oh, that's terrible! What can we do about it?" 

What this kind of comparative information doesn't tell you is that perhaps Johnny is going on all 
eight cylinders while Caroline is coasting on four of her eight. But people are not graded against their 
potential or against the full use of their present capacity. They are graded in relation to other people. 
And grades are carriers of social value; they open doors of opportunity or they close them. 
Competition, not cooperation, lies at the core of the educational process. Cooperation, in fact, is 
usually associated with cheating. 

Another powerful programming agent is athletics, particularly for young men in their high school or 
college years. Often they develop the basic paradigm that life is a big game, a zero sum game where 
some win and some lose. "Winning" is "beating" in the athletic arena. 

Another agent is law. We live in a litigious society. Thefirst thing many people think about when 
they get into trouble is suing someone, taking him to court, "winning" at someone else's expense. But 
defensive minds are neither creative nor cooperative. 

Certainly we need law or else society will deteriorate. It provides survival, but it doesn't create 
synergy. At best it results in compromise. Law is based on an adversarial concept. The recent trend 
of encouraging lawyers and law schools to focus on peaceable negotiation, the techniques of win-win, 
and the use of private courts, may not provide the ultimate solution, but it does reflect a growing 
awareness of the problem. 

Certainly there is a place for win-lose thinking in truly competitive and low-trust situations. But 
most of life is not a competition. We don't have to live each day competing with our spouse, our 
children, our co-workers, our neighbors, and our friends. "Who's winning in your marriage?" is a 
ridiculous question. If both people aren't winning, both are losing. 

Most of life is an interdependent, not an independent, reality. Most results you want depend on 
cooperation between you and others. And the win-lose mentality is dysfunctional to that cooperation. 

Lose-Win 

Some people are programmed the other way-- lose-win. 

"I lose, you win." 

"Go ahead. Have your way with me." 

"Step on me again. Everyone does." 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


"I'ma loser. I'vealways been a loser." 

"I'm a peacemaker. I'll do anything to keep peace." 

Lose-win is worse than win-lose because it has no standards -- no demands, no expectations, no 
vision. People who think lose-win are usually quick to please or appease. They seek strength from 
popularity or acceptance. They have little courage to express their own feelings and convictions and 
are easily intimidated by the ego strength of others. 

In negotiation, lose-win is seen as capitulation -- giving in or giving up. In leadership style, it's 
permissiveness or indulgence. Lose-win means being a nice guy, even if "nice guys finish last. 

Win-lose people love lose-win people because they can feed on them. They love their weaknesses 
-- they take advantage of them. Such weaknesses complement their strengths. 

But the problem is that lose-win people bury a lot of feelings. And unexpressed feelings never die; 
they're buried alive and come forth in uglier ways. Psychosomatic illnesses, particularly of the 
respiratory, nervous, and circulatory systems often are the reincarnation of cumulative resentment, 
deep disappointment, and disillusionment repressed by the lose-win mentality. Disproportionate rage 
or anger, overreaction to minor provocation, and cynicism are other embodiments of suppressed 
emotion. 

Peoplewho are constantly repressing, not transcending, feelings towards a higher meaning find that 
it affects the quality of their self-esteem and eventually the quality of their relationships with others. 

Both win-lose and lose-win are weak positions, based in personal insecurities. In the short run, 
win-lose will produce more results because it draws on the often considerable strengths and talents of 
the people at the top. Lose-win is weak and chaotic from the outset. 

Many executives, managers, and parents swing back and forth, as if on a pendulum, from win-lose 
inconsideration to lose-win indulgence. When they can't stand confusion and lack of structure, 
direction, expectation, and discipline any longer, they swing back to win-lose-- until guilt undermines 
their resolve and drives them back to lose-win -- until anger and frustration drive them back to win-lose 
again. 

Lose-Lose 

When two win-lose people get together -- that is, when two determined, stubborn, ego-invested 
individuals interact -- the result will be lose-lose. Both will lose. Both will become vindictive and 
want to "get back" or "get even," blind to the fact that murder is suicide, that revenge is a two-edged 
sword. 

I know of a divorce in which the husband was directed by the judge to sell the assets and turn over 
half the proceeds to his ex-wife. In compliance, he sold a car worth over $10,000for $50 and gave $25 
to the wife. When the wife protested, the court clerk checked on the situation and discovered that the 
husband was proceeding in the same manner systematically through all of the assets. 

Some people become so centered on an enemy, so totally obsessed with the behavior of another 
person that they become blind to everything except their desire for that person to lose, even if it means 
losing themselves. Lose-lose is the philosophy of adversarial conflict, the philosophy of war. 

Lose-lose is also the philosophy of the highly dependent person without inner direction who is 
miserable and thinks everyone else should be, too. "If nobody ever wins, perhaps being a loser isn't so 
bad. 

Win 

Another common alternative is simply to think win. People with the win mentality don't 
necessarily want someone else to lose. That's irrelevant. What matters is that they get what they 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


want. 

When there is no sense of contest or competition, win is probably the most common approach in 
everyday negotiation. A person with the win mentality thinks in terms of securing his own ends -- 
and leaving it to others to secure theirs. 


Which Option Is Best? 

Of these five philosophies discussed so far -- win-win, win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, and win -- 
which is the most effective? The answer is, "It depends." If you win a football game, that means the 
other team loses. If you work in a regional office that is miles away from another regional office, and 
you don't have any functional relationship between the offices, you may want to compete in a win-lose 
situation to stimulate business. However, you would not want to set up a win-lose situation like the 
"Race to Bermuda" contest within a company or in a situation where you need cooperation among 
people or groups of people to achieve maximum success. 

If you value a relationship and the issue isn't really that important, you may want to go for lose-win 
in some circumstances to genuinely affirm the other person. "What I want isn't as important to me as 
my relationship with you. Let's do it your way this time." You might also go for lose-win if you feel 
the expense of ti me and effort to achievea win of any kind would violate other higher values. Maybe 
it just isn't worth it. 

There are circumstances in which you would want to win, and you wouldn't be highly concerned 
with the relationship of that win to others. If your child's life were in danger, for example, you might 
be peripherally concerned about other people and circumstances. But saving that life would be 
supremely important. 

The best choice, then, depends on reality. The challenge isto read that reality accurately and notto 
translate win-lose or other scripting into every situation. 

Most situations, in fact, are part of an interdependent reality, and then win-win is really the only 
vi abl e al ternati ve of the fi ve. 

Win-lose is not viable because, although I appear to win in a confrontation with you, your feelings, 
your attitudes toward me and our relationship have been affected. If I am a supplier to your company, 
for example, and I win on my terms in a particular negotiation, I may get what I want now. But will 
you come to me again? My short-term win will really be a long-term lose if I don't get your repeat 
business. So an interdependent win-lose is really lose-lose in the long run. 

If we come up with a lose-win, you may appear to get what you want for the moment. But how 
will that affect my attitude about working with you, about fulfilling the contract? I may not feel as 
anxious to please you. I may carry battle scars with me into any future negotiations. My attitude 
about you and your company may be spread as I associate with others in the industry. So we're into 
lose-lose again. Lose-lose obviously isn't viablein any context. 

And if I focus on my own win and don't even consider your point of view, there's no basis for any 
kind of productive relationship. 

In the long run, if it isn't a win for both of us, we both lose. That's why win-win is the only real 
alternative in interdependent realities. 

I worked with a client once, the president of a large chain of retail stores, who said, "Stephen, this 
win-win idea sounds good, but it is so idealistic. The tough, realistic business world isn't like that. 
There's win-lose everywhere, and if you're not out there playi ng the game, you just can't make it." 

"All right," I said, "try going for win-lose with your customers. Is that realistic?" 

"Well, no," he replied. 

"Why not?" 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyHfHsnt 


"I'd lose my customers." 

'Then, go for lose-win -- give the store away. Isthat realistic?" 

"No. No margin, no mission." 

As we considered the various alternatives, win-win appeared to be the only truly realistic approach. 

"I guess that's true with customers," he admitted, "but not with suppliers." 

"You are the customer of the supplier," I said. "Why doesn't the same principle apply?" 

"Well, we recently renegotiated our lease agreements with the mall operators and owners," he said. 
"We went in with a win-win attitude. We were open, reasonable, conciliatory. But they saw that 
position as being soft and weak, and they took us to the cleaners." 

"Well, why did you go for lose-win?" I asked. 

"We didn't. We went for win-win." 

"I thought you said they took you to the cleaners." 

'They did." 

"In other words, you lost." 

'That's right." 

"And they won." 

'That's right." 

"So what's that cal led?" 

When he realized that what he had called win-win was really lose-win, he was shocked. And as 
we examined the long-term impact of that lose-win, the suppressed feelings, the trampled values, the 
resentment that seethed under the surface of the relationship, we agreed that it was really a loss for both 
parties in the end. 

If this man had had a real win-win attitude, he would have stayed longer in the communication 
process, listened to the mall owner more, then expressed his point of view with more courage. He 
would have continued in the win-win spirit until a solution was reached and they both felt good about 
it. And that solution, that Third Alternative, would have been synergistic -- probably something 
neither of them had thought of on his own. 

Win-Win or No Deal TM 

If these individuals had not come up with a synergistic solution -- one that was agreeable to both -- 
they could havegonefor an even higher expression of win-win, Win-Win or No Deal. 

No deal basically means that if we can't find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to 
disagree agreeably -- no deal. No expectations have been created, no performance contracts 
established. I don't hire you or we don't take on a particular assignment together because it's obvious 
that our values or our goals are going in opposite directions. It is so much better to realize this up 
front instead of downstream when expectations have been created and both parties have been 
disillusioned. 

When you have no deal as an option in your mind, you feel liberated because you have no need to 
manipulate people, to push your own agenda, to drive for what you want. You can beopen. You can 
really try to understand thedeeper issues underlying the positions. 

With no deal as an option, you can honestly say, "I only want to go for win-win. I want to win, and 
I want you to win. I wouldn't want to get my way and have you not feel good about it, because 
downstream it would eventually surface and create a withdrawal. On the other hand, I don't think 
you would feel good if you got your way and I gave in. So let's work for a win-win. Let's really 
hammer it out. And if we can't find it, then let's agree that we won't make a deal at all. It would be 
better not to deal than to live with a decision that wasn't right for us both. Then maybe another time 
we might be ableto get together."

Some time after learning the concept of Win-Win or No Deal, the president of a small computer 
software company shared with me the foil owing experience: 

"We had developed new software which we sold on a five-year contract to a particular bank. The 
bank presidentwas excited about it, but his people weren't really behind the decision. 

"About a month later, that bank changed presidents. The new president came to me and said, 'I am 
uncomfortable with these software conversions. I have a mess on my hands. My people are all 
saying that they can't go through this and I reallyfeel I just can't push it at this point in time.' 

"My own company was in deep financial trouble. I knew I had every legal right to enforce the 
contract. But I had become convi need of the value of the principle of win-win. 

"So I told him 'We have a contract. Your bank has secured our products and our services to convert 
you to this program. But we understand that you're not happy about it. So what we'd like to do is 
give you back the contract, give you back your deposit, and if you are ever looking for a software 
solution in the future, come back and see us.' 

"I literally walked away from an $84,000 contract. It was close to financial suicide. But I feltthat, 
inthelong run, if the principle were true, itwould comeback and pay dividends. 

'Three months later, the new president called me. 'I'm now going to make changes in my date 
processing,' he said, 'and I want to do business with you.' He signed a contract for $240,000." 

Anything less than win-win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact 
in the long-term relationship. The cost of the impact needs to be carefully considered. If you can't 
reach a true win-win, you're very often better off to go for no deal. 

Win-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotional freedom in the family relationship. If family 
members can't agree on a video that everyone will enjoy, they can simply decide to do something else-- 
no deal - rather than havi ng some enjoy the eveni ng at the expense of others. 

I have a friend whose family has been involved in singing together for several years. When they 
were young, she arranged the music, made the costumes, accompanied them on the piano, and directed 
the performances. 

As the children grew older, their taste in music began to change and they wanted to have more say 
in what they performed and what they wore. They became less responsive to direction. 

Because she had years of experience in performing herself and felt closer to the needs of the older 
people at the rest homes where they planned to perform, she didn't feel that many of the ideas they 
were suggesting would be appropriate. At the same time, however, she recognized their need to 
express themselves and to be part of the decision-maki ng process. 

So she set up a Win-Win or No Deal. She told them she wanted to arrive at an agreement that 
everyone felt good about -- or they would simply find other ways to enjoy their talents. As a result, 
everyone felt free to express his or her feelings and ideas as they worked to set up a Win-Win 
Agreement, knowing that whether or not they could agree, there would be no emotional strings. 

The Win-Win or No Deal approach is most realistic at the beginning of a business relationship or 
enterprise. In a continuing business relationship, no deal may not be a viable option, which can create 
serious problems, especially for family businesses or businesses that are begun initially on the basis of 
friendship. 

In an effort to preserve the relationship, people sometimes go on for years making one compromise 
after another, thinking win-loseor lose-win even whiletalking win-win. This creates serious problems 
for the people and for the business, particularly if the competition operates on win-win and synergy. 

Without no deal, many such businesses simply deteriorate and either fail or have to be turned over 
to professional managers. Experience shows that it is often better in setting up a family business or a 
business between friends to acknowledge the possibility of no deal downstream and to establish some 
kind of buy/sell agreement so that the business can prosper without permanently damaging the 
relationship.

Of course there are some relationships where no deal isnotviable. I wouldn't abandon my child or 
my spouse and go for no deal (it would be better, if necessary, to go for compromise -- a low form of 
win-win). But in many cases, it is possible to go into negotiation with a full Win-Win or No Deal 
attitude. And thefreedom in the attitude is incredible. 

Five Dimensions of Win-Win 

Think Win-Win is the habit of interpersonal leadership. It involves the exercise of each of the 
unique human endowments -- self-awareness, imagination, conscience, and independent will -- in our 
relationships with others. It involves mutual learning, mutual influence, mutual benefits. 

It takes great courage as well as consideration to create these mutual benefits, particularly if we're 
interacting with others who are deeply scripted in win-los. 

That is why this habit involves principles of interpersonal leadership. Effective interpersonal 
leadership requires the vision, the proactive initiative, and the security, guidance, wisdom, and power 
that come from principle-centered personal leadership. 

The principle of win-win is fundamental to success in all our interactions, and it embraces five 
interdependent dimensions of life. It begins with character and moves toward relationships, out of 
which flow agreements. It is nurtured in an environment where structure and systems are based on 
win-win. And it involves process; wecannot achieve win-win ends with win-loseor lose-win means. 

Thefollowing diagram shows how these five dimensions relate to each other. 

Now let's consider each of thefivedimensions in turn. 

C haracter 

Character is the foundation of win-win, and everything else builds on that foundation. There are 
three character traits essential to the win-win paradigm. 

INTEGRITY. We've already defined integrity as the value we place on ourselves. H abits 1, 2, and 
3 help us develop and maintain integrity. As we clearly identify our values and proactively organize 
and execute around those values on a daily basis, we develop self-awareness and independent will by 
making and keeping meaningful promises and commitments. 

There's no way to go for a win in our own lives if we don't even know, in a deep sense, what 
constitutes a win--what is, in fact, harmonious with our innermost values. And if we can't make and 
keep commitments to ourselves as well as to others, our commitments become meaningless. We know 
it; others know it. They sense duplicity and become guarded. There's no foundation of trust and 
win-win becomes an ineffective superficial technique. Integrity isthecornerstoneinthefoundation. 

MATURITY. Maturity is the balance between courage and consideration. If a person can express 
his feelings and convictions with courage balanced with consideration for the feelings and convictions 
of another person, he is mature, particularly if the issue is very important to both parties. 

If you examine many of the psychological tests used for hiring, promoting, and training purposes, 
you will find that they are designed to evaluate this kind of maturity. Whether it's called the ego 
strength/empathy balance, the self confidence/ respect for others balance, the concern for 
people/ concern for tasks balance, "I'm okay, you're okay" in transactional analysis language, or 9.1,1.9, 
5.5, 9.9, in management grid language--the quality sought for is the balance of what I call courage and 
consideration. 

Respect for this quality is deeply ingrained in the theory of human interaction, management, and 
leadership. It is a deep embodiment of the P/ PC Balance. While courage may focus on getting the 
golden egg, consideration deals with the long-term welfare of the other stakeholders. The basic task of 
leadership is to increase the standard of living and the quality of life for all stakeholders.

Many people think in dichotomies, in either/or terms. They think if you're nice, you're not tough. 
But win-win is nice...and tough. It's twice as tough as win-lose. To go for win-win, you not only have 
to be nice, you have to be courageous. You not only have to be empathic, you have to be confident. 
You not only have to be considerate and sensitive, you have to be brave. To do that, to achieve that 
balance between courage and consideration, is the essence of real maturity and is fundamental to 
win-win. 

If I'm high on courage and low on consideration, how will I think? Win-lose. I'll be strong and 
ego bound. I'll havethe courage of my convictions, but I won't be very considerate of yours. 

To compensate for my lack of internal maturity and emotional strength, I might borrow strength 
from my position and power, or from my credentials, my seniority, my affiliation. 

If I'm high on consideration and low on courage, I'll think lose-win. I'll be so considerate of your 
convictions and desires thatl won't have the courage to express and actualize my own. 

H igh courage and consideration are both essential to win-win. It is the balance that is the mark of 
real maturity. If I have it, I can listen, I can empathically understand, but I can also courageously 
confront. 

ABUNDANCE MENTALITY TM. The third character trait essential to win-win is the Abundance 
Mentality, the paradigm that there is plenty out there for everybody. 

Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only 
so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the 
pie, it would mean less for everybody else. The Scarcity Mentality isthezero-sum paradigm of life. 

People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very difficult time sharing recognition and credit, power or 
profit -- even with those who help in the production. They also havea very hard time being genuinely 
happy for the successes of other people -- even, and someti mes especial ly, members of their own fami ly 
or close friends and associates. It's almost as if something is being taken from them when someone 
else receives special recognition or windfall gain or has remarkable success or achievement. 

Although they might verbally express happiness for others' success, inwardly they are eating their 
hearts out. Their sense of worth comes from being compared, and someone else's success, to some 
degree, means their failure. Only so many people can be "A" students; only one person can be 
"number one." To "win" simply means to "beat." 

Often, people with a Scarcity Mentality harbor secret hopes that others might suffer misfortune -- 
not terrible misfortune, but acceptable misfortune that would keep them "in their place." They're 
always comparing, always competing. They give their energies to possessing things or other people in 
order to increasethei r sense of worth. 

They want other people to be the way they want them to be. They often want to clone them, and 
they surround themselves with "yes" people -- people who won't challenge them, people who are 
weaker than they. 

It's difficult for people with a Scarcity Mentality to be members of a complementary team. They 
look on differences as signs of insubordination and disloyalty. 

The Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and 
security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It 
results in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, 
options, alternatives, and creativity. 

The Abundance Mentality takes the personal joy, satisfaction, and fulfillment of Habits 1, 2, and 3 
and turns it outward, appreciating the uniqueness, the inner direction, the proactive nature of others. 
It recognizes the unlimited possibilities for positive interactive growth and development, creating new 
Third Alternatives. 

Public Victory does not mean victory over other people. It means success in effective interaction 
that brings mutually beneficial results to everyone involved. Public Victory means working together, 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyR^Hairt 


communicating together, making things happen together that even the same people couldn't make 
happen by working independently. And Public Victory is an outgrowth of the Abundance Mentality 
paradigm. 

A character rich in integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality has a genuineness that goes far 
beyond technique, or lack of it, in human interaction. 

One thing I have found particularly helpful to win-lose people in developing a win-win character is 
to associate with some model or mentor who really thinks win-win. When people are deeply scripted 
in win-lose or other philosophies and regularly associate with others who are likewise scripted, they 
don't have much opportunity to see and experience the win-win philosophy in action. So I 
recommend reading literature, such as the inspiring biography of Anwar Sadat, In Search of Identity, 
and seeing movies like Chariots of Fire or plays like Les Miserables that expose you to models of 
win-win. 

But remember: If we search deeply enough within ourselves -- beyond the scripting, beyond the 
learned attitudes and behaviors-- the real validation of win-win, as well as every other correct principle, 
is in our own lives. 

Relationships 

From the foundation of character, we build and maintain win-win relationships. The trust, the 
Emotional Bank Account, is the essence of win-win. Without trust, the best we can do is compromise; 
without trust, we lack the credibility for open, mutual learning and communication and real creativity. 

But if our Emotional Bank Account is high, credibility is no longer an issue. Enough deposits have 
been made so that you know and I know that we deeply respect each other. We're focused on the 
issues, not on personalities or positions. 

Because we trust each other, we're open. We put our cards on the table. Even though we see 
things differently, I know that you're willing to listen with respect while I describe the young woman to 
you, and you know that I'll treat your description of the old woman with the same respect. We're both 
committed to try to understand each other's point of view deeply and to work together for the Third 
Alternative, the synergistic solution, that will be a better answer for both of us. 

A relationship where bank accounts are high and both parties are deeply committed to win-win is 
the ideal springboard for tremendous synergy (Habit 6). That relationship neither makes the issues 
any less real or important, nor eliminates the differences in perspective. But it does eliminate the 
negative energy normally focused on differences in personality and position and creates a positive, 
cooperative energy focused on thoroughly understanding the issue and resolving them in a mutually 
beneficial way. 

But what if that kind of relationship isn't there? What if you have to work out an agreement with 
someone who hasn't even heard of win-win and is deeply scripted in win-lose or some other 
philosophy? 

Dealing with win-lose is the real test of win-win. Rarely is win-win easily achieved in any 
circumstance. Deep issues and fundamental differences have to be dealt with. But it is much easier 
when both parties are aware of and committed to it and where there is a high Emotional Bank Account 
in the relationship. 

When you're dealing with a person who is coming from a paradigm of win-lose, the relationship is 
still the key. The place to focus is on your Circle of Influence. You make deposits into the Emotional 
Bank Account through genuine courtesy, respect, and appreciation for that person and for the other 
point of view. You stay longer in the communication process. You listen more, you listen in greater 
depth. You express yourself with greater courage. You aren't reactive. You go deeper inside 
yourself for strength of character to be proactive. You keep hammering it out until the other person 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


begins to realize that you genuinely want the resolution to be a real win for both of you. That very 
process is a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. 

And the stronger you are -- the more genuine your character, the higher your level of proactivity, 
the more committed you really are to win-win -- the more powerful your influence will be with that 
other person. This is the real test of interpersonal leadership. It goes beyond transactional leadership 
into transformational leadership, transforming the indivi duals involved aswell as the relationship. 

Because win-win is a principle people can validate in their own lives, you will be able to bring most 
people to a realization that they will win more of what they want by going for what you both want. 
But there will be a few who are so deeply embedded in the win-lose mentality that they just won't 
Think Win-Win. So remember that no deal is always an option. Or you may occasionally choose to 
go for the low form of win-win -- compromise. 

It's important to realize that not all decisions need to be win-win, even when the Emotional Bank 
Account is high. Again, the key is the relationship. If you and I worked together, for example, and 
you were to come to me and say, "Stephen, I know you won't like this decision. I don't have time to 
explain it to you, let alone get you involved. There's a good possibility you'll think it's wrong. But 
will you support it?" 

If you had a positive Emotional Bank Account with me, of course I'd support it. I'd hope you were 
right and I was wrong. I'd work to make your decision work. 

But if the Emotional Bank Account weren't there, and if I were reactive, I wouldn't really support it. 
I might say I would to your face, but behind your back I wouldn't be very enthusiastic. I wouldn't 
make the investment necessary to make it succeed. "It didn't work," I'd say. "So what do you want 
me to do now?" 

If I were overreactive, I might even torpedo your decision and do what I could to make sure others 
did too. Or I might become "maliciously obedient" and do exactly and only what you tell me to do, 
accepting no responsibility for results. 

During the five years I lived in Great Britain, I saw that country brought twice to its knees because 
the train conductors were maliciously obedient in following all the rules and procedures written on 
paper. 

An agreement means very little in letter without the character and relationship base to sustain it in 
spirit. So we need to approach win-win from a genuine desire to invest in the relationships that make 
it possible. 

Agreements 

From relationships flow the agreements that give definition and direction to win-win. They are 
sometimes called performance agreements or partnership agreements, or shifting the paradigm of 
productive interaction from vertical to horizontal, from hovering supervision to self-supervision, from 
positioning to being partners in success. 

Win-Win Agreements cover a wide scope of interdependent interaction. We discussed one 
important application when wetalked about delegation in the "Green and Clean" story in Habit 3. The 
same five elements we listed there provide the structure for Win-Win Agreements between employers 
and employees, between independent people working together on projects, between groups of people 
cooperatively focused on a common objective, between companies and suppliers -- between any people 
who need to interact to accomplish. They create an effective way to clarify and manage expectations 
between people involved in any .interdependent endeavor. 

Desired results (not methods) identify what isto bedoneand when. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyR^Hairt 


Guidelines specify the parameters (principles, policies, etc.) within which results are to be 
accomplished 

Resources identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational support available to help 
accomplish the results. 

Accountability sets up the standards of performance and the time of evaluation. 

Consequences specify -- good and bad, natural and logical -- what does and will happen as a result 
of the evaluation. 

These five elements give Win-Win Agreements a life of their own. A clear mutual understanding 
and agreement up front in these areas creates a standard against which people can measure their own 
success. 

Traditional authoritarian supervision is a win-lose paradigm. It's also the result of an overdrawn 
Emotional Bank Account. If you don't have trust or common vision of desired results, you tend to 
hover over, check up on, and direct. Trust isn't there, so you feel as though you have to control people. 

But if the trust account is high, what is your method? Get out of their way. As long as you have 
an up-front Win-Win Agreement and they know exactly what is expected, your role is to be a source of 
help and to receive their accountability reports. 

It is much more ennobling to the human spirit to let people judge themselves than to judge them. 
And in a high-trust culture, it's much more accurate. In many cases people know in their hearts how 
things are going much better than the records show. Discernment is often far more accurate than 
either observation or measurement. 

Win-Win Management Training 

Several years ago, I was indirectly involved in a consulting project with a very large banking 
institution that had scores of branches. They wanted us to evaluate and improve their management 
training program, which was supported by an annual budget of $750,000. The program involved 
selecting college graduates and putting them through twelve two-week assignments in various 
departments over a six-month period of time so that they could get a general sense of the industry. 
They spent two week in commercial loans, two weeks in industrial loans, two weeks in marketing, two 
week in operations, and so forth. At the end of the six-month period, they were assigned as assistant 
managers in the various branch banks. 

Our assignment was to evaluate the six-month formal training period. As we began, we discovered 
that the most d iff i cu 11 part of the assi gn ment w as to get a cl ear pi ctu re of the d esi red resu I ts. We asked 
the top executives the key hard question: "What should these people be able to do when they finish the 
program?" And the answers we got were vague and often contradictory. 

The training program dealt with methods, not results; so we suggested that they set up a pilot 
training program based on a different paradigm called "learner-controlled instruction." This was a 
Win-Win Agreement that involved identifying specific objectives and criteria that would demonstrate 
their accomplishment and identifying the guidelines, resources, accountability, and consequences that 
would result when the objectives were met. The consequences in this case were promotion to assistant 
manager, where they would receive the on-the-job part of their training, and a significant increase in 
salary. 

We had to really press to get the objectives hammered out. "What is it you want them to 
understand about accounting? What about marketing? What about real estate loans?" And we 
went down the list. They finally came up with over 100 objectives, which we simplified, reduced, and 
consolidated until wecamedown to 39 specific behavioral objectives with criteria attached to them. 

The trainees were highly motivated by both the opportunity and the increased salary to meet the 
criteria as soon as possible. There was a big win in it for them, and there was also a big win for the 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


company because they would have assistant branch managers who met results-oriented criteria instead 
of just showing up for 12 different activity traps. 

So we explained the difference between learner-controlled instruction and system-controlled 
instruction to the trainees. We basically said, "Here are the objectives and the criteria. Here are the 
resources, including learning from each other. So go to it. As soon as you meet the criteria, you will 
be promoted to assistant managers. 

They were finished in three and a half weeks. Shifting the training paradigm had released 
unbelievable motivation and creativity 

As with many Paradigm Shifts, there was resistance. Almost all of the top executives simply 
wouldn't believe it. When they were shown the evidence that the criteria had been met, they basically 
said, "These trainees don't have the experience. They lack the seasoning necessary to give them the 
kind of judgment we want them to have as assistant branch managers." 

In talking with them later, we found that what many of them were really saying was, "We went 
through goat week; how come these guys don't have to?" But of course they couldn't put it that way. 
'They lack seasoning" was a much more acceptable expression. 

In addition, for obvious reasons (including the $750,000 budget for a six-month program), the 
personnel department was upset. 

So we responded, "Fair enough. Let's develop some more objectives and attach criteria to them. 
But let's stay with the paradigm of learner-controlled instruction." We hammered out eight more 
objectives with very tough criteria in order to give the executives the assurance that the people were 
adequately prepared to be assistant branch managers and continue the on-the-job part of the training 
program. After participating in some of the sessions where these criteria were developed, several of 
the executives remarked that if the trainees could meet these tough criteria, they would be better 
prepared than almost any who had gonethrough the six-month program. 

We had prepared the trainees to expect resistance. We took the additional objectives and criteria 
back to them and said, "Just as we expected, management wants you to accomplish some additional 
objectives with even tougher criteria than before. They have assured us this time that if you meet these 
criteria, they will make you assistant managers." 

They went to work in unbelievable ways. They went to the executives in departments such as 
accounting and basically said, "Sir, I am a member of this new pilot program called learner-controlled 
instruction, and it is my understanding that you participated in developing the objectives and the 
criteria." 

"I have six criteria to meet in this particular department. I was able to pass three of them off with 
skills I gained in college; I was able to get another one out of a book; I learned the fifth one from Tom, 
the fellow you trained last week. I only have one criterion left to meet, and I wonder if you or 
someone else in the department might be able to spend a few hours with me to show me how." So 
they spent a half a day in a department i nstead of two weeks. 

These trainees cooperated with each other, brainstormed with each other, and they accomplished 
the additional objectives in a week and a half. The six-month program was reduced to five weeks, and 
the resu I ts w ere si g n i fi cantl y i ncreased. 

This kind of thinking can similarly affect every area of organizational life if people have the courage 
to explore their paradigms and to concentrate on win-win. I am always amazed at the results that 
happen, both to individuals and to organizations, when responsible, proactive, self-directing 
individuals are turned loose on a task. 


Win-Win Performance Agreements 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyR^Hairt 


Creating Win-Win Performance Agreements requires vital Paradigm Shifts. The focus is on results; 
not methods. Most of us tend to supervise methods. We use the gofer delegation discussed in Habit 
3, the methods management I used with Sandra when I asked her to take pictures of our son as he was 
waterskiing. But Win-Win Agreements focus on results, releasing tremendous individual human 
potential and creating greater synergy, building PC in the process instead of focusing exclusively on P 

With win-win accountability, people evaluate themselves. The traditional evaluation games people 
play are awkward and emotionally exhausting. In win-win, people evaluate themselves, using the 
criteria that they themselves helped to create up front. And if you set it up correctly, people can do 
that. With a Win-Win Delegation Agreement, even a seven-year-old boy can tell for himself how well 
he's keeping the yard "green and clean." 

My best experiences in teaching university classes have come when I have created a win-win shared 
understanding of the goal up front. "This is what we're trying to accomplish. Here are the basic 
requirements for an A, B, or C grade. My goal is to help every one of you get an A. Now you take 
what we've talked about and analyze it and come up with your own understanding of what you want 
to accomplish that is uniqueto you. Then let's get together and agree on thegradeyou want and what 
you plan to do to get it." 

Management philosopher and consultant Peter Drucker recommends the use of a "manager's letter" 
to capture the essence of performance agreements between managers and their employees. Following 
a deep and thorough discussion of expectations, guidelines, and resources to make sure they are in 
harmony with organizational goals, the employee writes a letter to the manager that summarizes the 
discussion and indicates when the next performance plan or review discussion will take place. 

Developing such a Win-Win Agreement is the central activity of management. With an agreement 
in place, employees can manage themselves within the framework of that agreement. The manager 
then can serve I i ke a pace car i n a race. H e can get thi ngs goi ng and then get out of the way. His job 
from then on is to remove the oil spills. 

When a boss becomes the first assistant to each of his subordinates, he can greatly increase his span 
of control. Entire levels of ad ministrations and overhead are eliminated. Instead of supervising six or 
eight, such a manager can supervise twenty, thirty, fifty, or more. 

In Win-Win Agreements, consequences become the natural or logical results of performance rather 
than a reward or punishment arbitrarily handed out by the person in charge. 

There are basically four kinds of consequences (rewards and penalties) that management or parents 
can control -- financial, psychic, opportunity, and responsibility. Financial consequences include such 
things as income, stock options, allowances, or penalties. Psychic or psychological consequences 
include recognition, approval, respect, credibility, or the loss of them. Unless peopleare in a survival 
mode, psychic compensation is often more motivating than financial compensation. Opportunity 
includes training, development, perks, and other benefits. Responsibility has to do with scope and 
authority, either of which can be enlarged or diminished. Win-Win Agreements specify consequences 
in one or more of those areas and the people involved know it up front. So you don't play games. 
Everything is clear from the beginning. 

In addition to these logical, personal consequences, it is also important to clearly identify what the 
natural organizational consequences are. For example, what will happen if I'm late to work, if I refuse 
to cooperate with others, if I don't develop good Win-Win Agreements with my subordinates, if I don't 
hold them accountable for desired results, or if I don't promote their professional growth and career 
development. 

When my daughter turned 16, we set up a Win-Win Agreement regarding use of the family car. 
Weagreed thatshewould obey the laws of the land and thatshewould keep the car clean and properly 
maintained. Weagreed that she would use the car only for responsible purposes and would serve as a 
cab driver for her mother and me within reason. And we also agreed that she would do all her other 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


jobs cheerfully without being reminded. These were our wins. 

We also agreed that I would provide some resources -- the car, gas, and insurance. And we agreed 
that she would meet weekly with me, usually on Sunday afternoon, to evaluate how she was doing 
based on our agreement. The consequences were clear. As long as she kept her part of the agreement, 
she could usethecar. If she didn't keep it, shewould lose the privilege until shedecided to. 

This Win-Win Agreement set up clear expectations from the beginning on both our parts. It was a 
win for her -- she got to use the car -- and it was certainly a win for Sandra and me. Now she could 
handle her own transportation needs and even some of ours. We didn't have to worry about 
maintaining the car or keeping it clean. And we had a built-in accountability, which meant I didn't 
have to hover over her to manage her methods. Her integrity, her conscience, her power of 
discernment and our high Emotional Bank Account managed her infinitely better. We didn't have to 
get emotionally strung out, trying to supervise her every move and coming up with punishments or 
rewards on the spot if she didn't do things the way we thought she should. We had a Win-Win 
Agreement, and it liberated us all. 

Win-Win Agreements are tremendously liberating. But as the product of isolated techniques, they 
won't hold up. Even if you set them up in the beginning, there is no way to maintain them without 
personal integrity and relationship of trust. 

A true Win-Win Agreement is the product of the paradigm, the character, and the relationships out 
of which it grows. In this context, it defines and directs the interdependent interaction of which it was 
created. 

Win-win can only survive in an organization when the systems support it. If you talk win-win but 
reward win-lose, you'vegot a losing program on your hands. 

You basically get what you reward. If you want to achieve the goals and reflectthe values in your 
mission statement, then you need to align the reward system with these goals and values. If it isn't 
aligned systematically, you won't be walking your talk. You'll be in the situation of the manager I 
mentioned earlier who talked cooperation but practiced competition by creating a "Race to Bermuda" 
contest. 

I worked for several years with a very large real estate organization in the M iddle West. My first 
experience with this organization was at a large sales rally where over 800 sales associates gathered for 
the annual reward program. It was a psych-up cheerleading session, complete with high school bands 
and a great deal of frenzied screaming. 

Out of the 800 people there, around 40 received awards for top performance, such as "Most Sales," 
"Greatest Volume," "Highest Earned Commissions," and "Most Listings." There was a lot of hoopla -- 
excitement, cheering, applause -- around the presentation of these awards. There was no doubt that 
those 40 people had won; but there was also the underlying awareness that 760 people had lost. 

We immediately began educational and organizational development work to align the systems and 
structures of the organization toward the win-win paradigm. We involved people at a grass-roots 
level to develop the kinds of systems that would motivate them. We also encouraged them to 
cooperate and synergizewith each other so that as many as possible could achieve the desired results of 
their individually tailored performance agreements. 

At the next ral ly one year later, there were over 1,000 sales associates present, and about 800 of them 
received awards. There were a few individual winners based on comparisons, but the program 
primarily focused on people achieving self-selected performance objectives and on groups achieving 
team objectives. There was no need to bring in the high school bands to artificially contrive the fanfare, 
the cheerleading, and the psych up. There was tremendous natural interest and excitement because 
people could share in each others' happiness, and teams of sales associates could experience rewards 
together, including a vacation trip for the entire office.

The remarkable thing was that almost all of the 800 who received the awards that year had 
produced as much per person in terms of volume and profit as the previous year's 40. The spirit of 
win-win had significantly increased the number of golden eggs and had fed the goose as well, releasing 
enormous human energy and talent. The resulting synergy was astounding to almost everyone 
involved. 

Competition has its place in the marketplace or against last year's performance -- perhaps even 
against another office or individual where there is no particular interdependence, no need to cooperate. 
But cooperation in the workplace is as important to free enterprise as competition in the marketplace. 
The spirit of win-win cannot survive in an environment of competition and contests. 

For win-win to work, the systems have to support it. The training system, the planning system, the 
communication system, the budgeting system, the information system, the compensation system -- all 
have to be based on the principleof win-win. 

I did some consulting for another company that wanted training for their people in human relations. 
The underlying assumption was that the problem was the people. 

The president said, "Go into any store you want and see how they treat you. They're just order 
takers. They don't understand how to get close to the customers. They don't know the product and 
they don't have the knowledge and the skill in the sales process necessary to create a marriage between 
the product and the need." 

Sol went to the various stores. And he was right. But that still didn't answer the question in my 
mind: What caused the attitude? 

"Look, we're on top of the problem," the president said. "We have department heads out there 
setting a great example. We've told them their job is two-thirds selling and one-third management, 
and they're outselling everybody. We just want you to provide some training for the salespeople. 

Those words raised a red flag. "Let's get some more data," I said. 

He didn't I ike that. He "knew" what the problem was, and he wanted to get on with training. But 
I persisted, and within two days we uncovered the real problem. Because of the job definition and the 
compensation system, the managers were "creaming." They'd stand behind the cash register and 
cream all the business during the slow times. Half thetimein retail isslow and the other half is frantic. 
So the managers would give all the dirty jobs -- inventory control, stock work, and cleaning -- to the 
salespeople. And they would stand behind the registers and cream. That's why the department 
heads were top in sales. 

So we changed one system -- the compensation system - and the problem was corrected overnight. 
We set up a system whereby the managers only made money when their salespeople made money. 
We overlapped the needs and goals of the managers with the needs and goals of the salespeople. And 
the need for human-relationstraining suddenly disappeared. The key was developing a true win-win 
reward system. 

In another instance, I worked with a manager in a company that required formal performance 
evaluation. He was frustrated over the evaluation rating he had given a particular manager. "He 
deserved a three," he said, "but I had to give him a one" (which meant superior, promotable). 

"What did you give him a one for?" I asked. 

"He gets the numbers," was his reply. 

"So why do you think he deserves a three?" 

"It's the way he gets them. He neglects people; he runs over them. He's a troublemaker." 

"It sounds like he's totally focused on P -- on production. And that's what he's being rewarded for. 
But what would happen if you talked with him about the problem, if you helped him understand the 
importance of PC?" 

He said he had done so, with no effect. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


'Then what if you set up a win-win contract with him where you both agreed that two-thirds of his 
compensation would come from P -- from numbers -- and the other one-third would come from PC -- 
how other people perceive him, what kind of leader, people builder, team builder he is?" 

"Now that would get his attention," he replied. 

So often the problem is in the system, not in the people. If you put good people in bad systems, 
you get bad results. You have to water the flowers you wanttogrow. 

As people really learn to Think Win-Win, they can set up the systems to create and reinforce it. 
They can transform unnecessarily competitive situations to cooperative ones and can powerfully impact 
their effectiveness by building both P and PC. 

In business, executives can align their systems to create teams of highly productive people working 
together to compete against external standards of performance. In education, teachers can set up 
grading systems based on an individual's performance in the context of agreed-upon criteria and can 
encourage students to cooperate in productive ways to help each other learn and achieve. In families, 
parents can shift the focus from competition with each other to cooperation. In activities such as 
bowling, for example, they can keep a family score and try to beat a previous one. They can set up 
home responsibilities with Win-Win Agreements that eliminate constant nagging and enable parents to 
do the thi ngs only they can do. 

A friend once shared with meacartoon he'd seen of two children talking to each other. "If mommy 
doesn't get us up soon," one was saying, "we're going to be late for school." These words brought 
forcibly to his attention the nature of the problems created when families are not organized on a 
responsible win-win basis. 

Win-win puts the responsibility on the individual for accomplishing specified results within clear 
guidelines and available resources. It makes a person accountableto perform and evaluate the results 
and provides consequences as a natural result of performance. And win-win systems create the 
environment which supports and reinforces the Win-Win Agreements. 

Processes 

There's no way to achieve win-win ends with win-lose or lose-win means. You can't say, "You're 
going to Think Win-Win, whether you like it or not." So the question becomes how to arrive at a 
win-win solution. 

Roger Fisher and William Ury, two Harvard law professors, have done some outstanding work in 
what they call the "principled" approach versus the "positional" approach to bargaining in their 
tremendously useful and insightful book, Getting to Yes. Although the words win-win are not used, 
the spirit and underlying philosophy of the book are in harmony with the win-win approach. 

They suggest that the essence of principled negotiation is to separate the person from the problem, 
to focus on interests and not on positions, to invent options for mutual gain, and to insist on objective 
criteria - some external standard or principle that both parties can buy into. 

In my own work with various people and organizations seeking win-win solutions, I suggest that 
they become involved in thefollowing four-step process: First, seethe problem from the other point of 
view. Really seek to understand and give expression to the needs and concerns of the other party as 
welI as or better than they can themselves. Second, identify the key issues and concerns (not positions) 
involved. Third, determine what results would constitute a fully acceptable solution. And fourth, 
identify possible new options to achieve those results. 

Habits 5 and 6 deal directly with two of the elements of this process, and we will go into those in 
depth in the next two chapters. 

But at this juncture, let me point out the highly interrelated nature of the process of win-win with 
the essence of win-win itself. You can only achieve win-win solutions with win-win processes -- the 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Heart 


end and the means are the same. 

Win-win is not a personality technique. It's a total paradigm of human interaction. It comes from 
a character of integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality. It grows out of high-trust 
relationships. It is embodied in agreements that effectively clarify and manage expectations as well as 
accomplishments. It thrives in supportive systems. And it is achieved through the process we are 
now prepared to more fully examine in Habits 5 and 6. 

Application Suggestions: 

1. Think about an upcoming interaction wherein you will be attempting to reach an agreement or 
negotiate a solution. Committo maintain a balance between courage and consideration. 

2. Make a list of obstacles that keep you from applying the win-win paradigm more frequently. 
Determi ne what could be done within your Ci rcle of I nfl uence to el i minate some of those obstacles. 

3. Select a specific relationship where you would like to develop a Win-Win Agreement. Try to 
put yourself in the other person's place, and write down explicitly how you think that person sees the 
solution. Then list, from your own perspective, what results would constitute a win for you. 
Approach the other person and ask if he or she would be willing to communicate until you reach a 
point of agreement and mutually beneficial solution. 

4. Identify three key relationships in your life. Give some indication of what you feel the balance 
is in each of the Emotional Bank Accounts. Write down some specific ways you could make deposits 
in each account. 

5. Deeply consider your own scripting. Is it win-lose? How does that scripting affect your 
interactions with other people? Can you identify the main source of that script? Determine whether 
or not those scri pts serve wel I i n your current real ity. 

6. Try to identify a model of win-win thinking who, even in hard situations, really seeks mutual 
benefit. Determine now to more closely watch and learn from this person's example. 

Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood TM 

Principles of Empathic Communication 

The heart has its reasons which reason knows not of. 

- Pascal 

Suppose you've been having trouble with your eyes and you decideto go to an optometrist for help. 
After briefly listening to your complaint, he takes off his glasses and handsthem to you. 

"Put these on," he says. "I've worn this pair of glasses for 10 years now and they've really helped 
me. I have an extra pai r at home; you can wear these." 

So you put them on, but it only makes the problem worse 
'This is terri ble!" you exclaim. "I can't see a thing!" 

"Well, what's wrong?" he asks. 'They work great for me. Try harder." 

"I am trying," you insist. "Everything is a blur." 

"Well, what's the matter with you? Think positively." 

"Okay. I positively can't see a thing." 

"Boy, you are ungrateful!" he chides. "And after all I've done to help you!" 

What are the chances you'd go back to that optometrist the next time you need help? Not very 
good, I would imagine. You don't have much confidence in someone who doesn't diagnose before he

or she prescribes. 

But how often do wediagnose before we prescribe in communication? 

"Comeon, honey, tell me how you feel. I know it's hard, but I'll try to understand." 

"Oh, I don't know, Mom. You'd think it was stupid." 

"Of course I wouldn't! You can tell me. Honey, no one cares for you as much as I do. I'm only 
interested in your welfare. What's making you so unhappy?" 

"Oh, I don't know." 

"Come on, honey. What is it?" 

"Wei I, to tel I you the truth, I just don't I ike school anymore." 

"What?" you respond incredulously. "What do you mean you don't like school? And after all the 
sacrifices we've made for your education! Education is the foundation of your future. If you'd apply 
yourself like your older sister does, you'd do better and then you'd like school. Time and time again, 
we've told you to settle down. You've got the ability, but you just don't apply yourself. Try harder. 
Get a positive attitude about it." 

Pause 

"N ow go ahead. Tel I me how you feel." 

Wehavesuch a tendency to rush in, tofixthings up with good advice. But weoften fail totakethe 
time to diagnose, to really, deeply understand the problem first. 

If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important principle I havelearned inthe field 
of interpersonal relations, it would be this: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood. This 
principle is the key to effective interpersonal communication. 

Character and Communication 

Right now, you're reading a book I've written. Reading and writing are both forms of 
communication. So are speaking and listening. In fact, those are the four basic types of 
communication. And think of all the hours you spend doing at least one of those four things. The 
ability to do them well is absolutely critical to your effectiveness. 

Communication is the most important skill in life. We spend most of our waking hours 
communicating. But consider this: You've spent years learning how to read and write, years learning 
how to speak. But what about listening? What training or education have you had that enables you 
to listen so that you really, deeply understand another human being from that individual's own frame 
of reference? 

Comparatively few people have had any training in listening at all. And, for the most part, their 
training has been in the personality ethic of technique, truncated from the character base and the 
relationship base absolutely vital to authentic understanding of another person. 

If you want to interact effectively with me, to influence me -- your spouse, your child, your neighbor, 
your boss, your coworker, your friend -- you first need to understand me. And you can't do that with 
technique alone. If I sense you're using some technique, I sense duplicity, manipulation. I wonder 
why you're doing it, what your motives are. And I don't feel safe enough to open myself up to you. 

The real key to your influence with me is your example, your actual conduct. Your example flows 
naturally out of your character, of the kind of person you truly are -- not what others say you are or 
whatyou may want me to think you are. It is evident in how I actually experience you. 

Your character is constantly radiating, communicating. From it, in the long run, I come to 
instinctively trust or distrust you and your efforts with me. 

If your life runs hot and cold, if you're both caustic and kind, and, above all, if your private 
performance doesn't square with your public performance, it's very hard for me to open up with you. 
Then, as much as I may want and even need to receive your love and influence, I don't feel safe enough 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


to expose my opinions and experiences and my tender feelings. Who knows what will happen? 

But unless I open up with you, uni ess you understand me and my unique situation and feelings, you 
won't know how to advise or counsel me. What you say is good and fine, but it doesn't quite pertain 
to me. 

You may say you care about and appreciate me. I desperately want to believe that. But how can 
you appreciate me when you don't even understand me? All I have are your words, and I can't trust 
words. 

I'm too angry and defensive-- perhaps too guilty and afraid --to beinfluenced, even though insidel 
know I need what you could tell me. 

Unless you're influenced by my uniqueness, I'm not going to be influenced by your advice. So if 
you want to be really effective in the habit of interpersonal communication, you cannot do it with 
technique alone. You have to build the skills of empathic listening on a base of character that inspires 
openness and trust. And you have to build the Emotional Bank Accounts that create a commerce 
between hearts. 

Empathic Listening 

"Seek first to understand" involves a very deep shift in paradigm. We typically seek first to be 
understood. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to 
reply. They're either speaking or preparing to speak. They're filtering everything through their own 
paradigms, reading their autobiography into other people's lives. 

"Oh, I know exactly how you feel!" 

"I went through the very same thing. Let me tell you about my experience." 

They're constantly projecting their own home movies onto other people's behavior. They prescribe 
thei r own glasses for everyone with whom they interact. 

If they have a problem with someone -- a son, a daughter, a spouse, an employee -- their attitude is, 
'That person just doesn't understand." 

A father once told me, "I can't understand my kid. He just won't listen to me at all." 

"Let me restate what you just said," I replied. "You don't understand your son because he won't 
listen to you?" 

'That's right," he replied. 

"Let me try again," I said. "You don't understand your son because he won't listen to you?" 

'That's what I said," he impatiently replied. 

"I thought that to understand another person, you needed to listen to him," I suggested. 

"OH!" he said. There was a long pause. "Oh!" he said again, as the light began to dawn. "Oh, 
yeah! But I do understand him. I know what he's going through. I went through the same thing 
myself. I guess what I don't understand is why he won't listen to me." 

This man didn't have the vaguest idea of what was really going on inside his boy's head. He 
looked into his own head and thought he saw the world, including his boy. 

That's the case with so many of us. We're filled with our own rightness, our own autobiography. 
We want to be understood. Our conversations become collective monologues, and we never really 
understand what's going on insideanother human being. 

When another person speaks, we're usually "listening" at one of four levels. We may be ignoring 
another person, not really listening at all. We may practice pretending. "Yeah. Uh-huh. Right." 
We may practice selective listening, hearing only certain parts of the constant chatter of a preschool 
child. Or we may even practice attentive listening, paying attention and focusing energy on thewords 
that are being said. But very few of us ever practice the fifth level, the highest form of listening, 
empathic listening. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


When I say empathic listening, I am not referring to the techniques of "active" listening or "reflective" 
listening, which basically involve mimicking what another person says. That kind of listening is 
skill-based, truncated from character and relationship, and often insults those "listened" to in such a 
way. It is also essentially autobiographical. If you practice those techniques, you may not project 
your autobiography in the actual interaction, but your motive in listening is autobiographical. You 
listen with reflective ski I Is, but you listen with intent to reply, to control, to manipulate. 

When I say empathic listening, I mean listening with intent to understand. I mean seeking first to 
understand, to really understand. It's an entirely different paradigm. 

Empathic (from empathy) listening gets inside another person's frame of reference. You look out 
through it, you see the world the way they see the world, you understand their paradigm, you 
understand how they feel. 

Empathy is not sympathy. Sympathy is a form of agreement, a form of judgment. And it is 
sometimes the more appropriate emotion and response. But people often feed on sympathy. It 
makes them dependent. The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it's that 
you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually. 

Empathic listening involves much more than registering, reflecting, or even understanding the 
words that are said. Communications experts estimate, in fact, that only 10 percent of our 
communication is represented by the words we say. Another 30 percent is represented by our sounds, 
and 60 percent by our body language. In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, 
and more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for feeling, for meaning. 
You listen for behavior. You use your right brain as well as your left. You sense, you intuit, you feel. 

Empathic listening is so powerful because it gives you accurate data to work with. Instead of 
projecting your own autobiography and assuming thought, feelings, motives, and interpretation, you're 
dealing with the reality inside another person's head and heart. You're listening to understand. 
You're focused on receiving thedeep communication of another human soul. 

In addition, empathic listening is the key to making deposits in Emotional Bank Accounts, because 
nothing you do is a deposit unless the other person perceives it as such. You can work your fingers to 
the bone to make a deposit, only to have it turn into a withdrawal when a person regards your efforts as 
manipulative, self-serving, intimidating, or condescending because you don't understand what really 
matters to him. 

Empathic listening is, in and of itself, a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. It's 
deeply therapeutic and healing because it gives a person "psychological air. 

If all the air were suddenly sucked out of the room you're in right now, what would happen to your 
interest in this book? You wouldn't care about the book; you wouldn't care about anything except 
getting air. Survival would be your only motivation. 

But now that you haveair, it doesn't motivate you. This is one of the greatest insights in thefield of 
human motivations: Satisfied needs do not motivate. It's only the unsatisfied need that motivates. 
Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival -- to be 
understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated. 

When you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air. And 
after that vital need is met, you can then focus on influencing or problem solving. 

This need for psychological air impacts communication in every area of life. 

I taught this concept at a seminar in Chicago onetime, and I instructed the participants to practice 
empathic listening during the evening. The next morning, a man came up to me almost bursting with 
news. 

"Let me tell you what happened last night," he said. "I was trying to close a big commercial real 
estate deal while I was here in Chicago. I met with the principals, their attorneys, and another real 
estate agent who had just been brought in with an alternative proposal. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


"It looked as if I were going to lose the deal. I had been working on this deal for over six months 
and, in a very real sense, all my eggs were in this one basket. All of them. I panicked. I did 
everything I could -- I pulled out all the stops -- I used every sales technique I could. The final stop 
was to say, 'Could we delay this decision just a little longer?' But the momentum was so strong and 
they were so disgusted by having this thing go on so long, it was obvious they were going to close. 

"So I said to myself, 'Well, why not try it? Why not practice what I learned today and seek first to 
understand, then to be understood? I've got nothing to lose.' 

"I just said to the man, 'Let me see if I really understand what your position is and what your 
concerns about my recommendations really are. When you feel I understand them, then we'll see 
whether my proposal has any relevance or not.' 

"I really tried to put myself in his shoes. I tried to verbalize his needs and concerns, and he began 
to open up. 

'The more I sensed and expressed the things he was worried about, the results he anticipated, the 
more he opened up. 

"Finally, in the middle of our conversation, he stood up, walked over to the phone, and dialed his 
wife. Putting hishand over the mouthpiece, hesaid, 'You've got the deal.' 

"I was totally dumbfounded," he told me. "I still am this morning. 

He had made a huge deposit in the Emotional Bank Account by giving the man psychological air. 
When it comes right down to it, other things being relatively equal, the human dynamic is more 
i important than the technical dimensions of the deal. 

Seeking first to understand, diagnosing before you prescribe, is hard. It's so much easier in the 
short run to hand someonea pair of glasses that have fit you so well these many years. 

But in the long run, it severely depletes both P and PC. You can't achieve maximum 
interdependent production from an inaccurate understanding of where other people are coming from. 
And you can't have interpersonal PC -- high Emotional Bank Accounts -- if the people you relate with 
don't really feel understood. 

Empathic listening is also risky. It takes a great deal of security to go into a deep listening 
experience because you open yourself up to be influenced. You become vulnerable. It's a paradox, in 
a sense, because in order to have influence, you have to be influenced. That means you have to really 
understand. 

That's why Habits 1, 2, and 3 are so foundational. They give you the changeless inner core, the 
principle center, from which you can handlethe more outward vulnerability with peace and strength. 

Diagnose Before You Prescribe 

Although it's risky and hard, seek first to understand, or diagnose before you prescribe, is a correct 
principle manifesting many areas of life. It's the mark of all true professionals. It's critical for the 
optometrist, it's critical for the physician. You wouldn't have any confidence in a doctor's prescription 
unless you had confidence in the diagnosis 

When our daughter Jenny was only two months old, she was sick on Saturday, the day of a football 
game in our community that dominated the consciousness of almost everyone. It was an important 
game--some 60,000 people were there. Sandra and I would I i ke to have gone, but we didn't want to 
leave little Jenny. Her vomiting and diarrhea had us concerned 

The doctor was at that game. Hewasn't our personal physician, but he was the one on call. When 
Jenny's situation got worse, we decided we needed some medical advice 

Sandra dialed the stadium and had him paged. It was right at a critical time in the game, and she 
could sense on officious tone in his voice. "Yes?" hesaid briskly. "Whatisit?" 

'This is M rs. Covey, Doctor, and we're concerned about our daughter, Jenny." 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


"What's the situation?" he asked. 

Sandra described the symptoms and he said, "Okay. I'll call in a prescription. Which is your 
pharmacy?" 

When she hung up, Sandra felt that in her rush she hadn't really given him full data, but that what 
she had told him was adequate. 

"Do you think he realizes thatjenny is just a newborn?" I asked her 

"I'm surehedoes," Sandra replied. 

"But he's not ou r doctor. H e's never even treated her." 

"Well, I'm pretty sure he knows." 

"A re you willing to give her the medicine unless you're absolutely sure he knows?" 

Sandra was silent. "What are wegoing to do?" she finally said. 

"Call him back," I said. 

"You call him back," Sandra replied. 

So I did. He was paged out of the game once again. "Doctor," I said, "when you called in that 
prescription, did your realize that Jenny isjusttwo months old?" 

"No!" he exclaimed. "I didn't realize that. It's good you called me back. I'll change the 
prescription immediately." 

If you don't have confidence in the diagnosis, you won't have confidence in the prescription. 

This principle is also true in sales. An effective salesperson first seeks to understand the needs, the 
concerns, the situation of the customer. The amateur salesman sells products; the professional sells 
solutions to needs and problems. It's a totally different approach. The professional learns how to 
diagnose, how to understand. He also learns how to relate people's needs to his products and services. 
And, he has to have the integrity to say, "My product or service will not meet that need" if it will not. 

Diagnosing before you prescribe is also fundamental to law. The professional lawyer first gathers 
the facts to understand the situation, to understand the laws and precedents, before preparing a case. 
A good lawyer almost writes the opposing attorney's case before he writes his own. 

It's also true in product design. Can you imagine someone in a company saying, "This consumer 
research stuff is for the birds. Let's design products." In other words, forget understanding the 
consumer's buying habits and motives--just design products. It would never work. 

A good engineer will understand the forces, the stresses at work, before designing the bridge. A 
good teacher will assess the class before teaching. A good student will understand before he applies. 
A good parent will understand before evaluation or judging. The key to good judgment is 
understanding. By judging first, a person will never fully understand. 

Seek first to understand is a correct principle evident in all areas of life. It's a generic, 
common-denominator principle, but it has its greatest power in the area of interpersonal relations. 

Four Autobiographical Responses 

Because we listen autobiographically, we tend to respond in one of four ways. We evaluate -- we 
either agree or disagree; we probe -- we ask questions from our own frame of reference; we advise -- we 
give counsel based on our own experience; or we interpret --wetry to figure peopleout, to explain their 
motives, their behavior, based on our own motives and behavior. 

These responses come naturally to us. We are deeply scripted in them; we live around models of 
them all thetime. But how do they affect our ability to really understand? 

If I'm trying to communicate with my son, can he feel free to open himself up to me when I evaluate 
everything hesays before he really explains it? Ami giving him psychological air? 

And how does he feel when I probe? Probing is playing 20 questions. It's autobiographical, it 
controls, and it invades. It's also logical, and the language of logic is different from the language of 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

sentiment and emotion. You can play 20 questions all day and not find out what's important to 
someone. Constant probing is one of the main reasons parents do not get close to their children. 

"How's it going, son?" 

"Fine." 

"Well, what's been happening lately?" 

"Nothing." 

"So what's exciting at school?" 

"Not much." 

"And what are your plans for theweekend?" 

"I don't know." 

You can't get him off the phone talking with his friends, but all he gives you is one- and two-word 
answers. Your house is a motel where he eats and sleeps, but he never shares, never opens up. 

And when you think about it, honestly, why should he, if every time he does open up his soft 
underbelly, you elephant stomp it with autobiographical advice and "I told you so's." 

We are so deeply scripted in these responses that we don't even realize when we use them. I have 
taught this concept to thousands of people in seminars across the country, and it never fails to shock 
them deeply as we role-play empathic listening situations and they finally begin to listen to their own 
typical responses. But as they begin to see how they normally respond and learn how to listen with 
empathy, they can see the dramatic results in communication. To many, seek first to understand 
becomes the most exciting, the most immediately applicable, of all the Seven Habits. 

Let's take a look at what well might be a typical communication between a father and his teenage 
son. Look at thefather's words in terms of the four different responses we have just descri bed. 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" 

"What's the matter, Son?" (probing). 

"It's totally impractical. I don't get a thing out of it." 

"Well, you just can't see the benefits yet, Son. I felt the same way when I was your age." I 
remember thinking what a waste some of the classes were. But those classes turned out to be the most 
helpful to me later on. Just hang in there. Give it some time" (advising). 

"I've given it 10 years of mylife! Can you tell me what good'x plus y'is going to be to me as an 
auto mechanic?" 

"An auto mechanic? You've got to be kidding" (evaluating). 

"No, I'm not. Look at Joe. He's quit school. He's working on cars. And he's making lots of 
money. Now that's practical." 

"It may look that way now. But several years down the road, Joe's going to wish he'd stayed in 
school. You don't want to bean auto mechanic. You need an education to prepare you for something 
better than that" (advising). 

"I don't know. Joe's got a pretty good set-up." 

"Look, Son, have you really tried?" (probing, evaluating). 

"I've been in high school two years now. Sure I've tried. It'sjusta waste." 

'That's a highly respected school, Son. Givethem a little credit" (advising, evaluating). 

"Well, the other guys feel the same way I do." 

"Do you realize how many sacrifices your mother and I have made to get you to where you are? 
You can't quit when you've come this far" (evaluating). 

"I know you've sacrificed, Dad. But it's just not worth it." 

"Look, maybe if you spent more time doing your homework and less time in front of TV." (advising, 
evaluating). 

"Look, Dad. It's just no good. Oh, never mind! I don't want to talk about this anyway." 

Obviously, his father was well-intended. Obviously, he wanted to help. But did he even begin to 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

really understand? 

Let's look more carefully at the son -- not just his words, but his thoughts and feelings (expressed 
parenthetically below) and the possible effect of some of his dad's autobiographical responses. 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the bi rds!" (I want to talk with you, to get your attention.) 

"What's the matter, Son?" (You're interested! Good!) 

"It's totally impractical. I don't get a thing out of it." (I've got a problem with school, and I feel just 
terrible. 

"Well, you just can't see the benefits yet, son. I felt the same way when I was your age." (Oh, no! 
Here comes Chapter three of Dad's autobiography. This isn't what I want to talk about. I don'treally 
care how many mi les he had to trudge through the snow to school without any boots. I want to get to 
the problem.) "I remember thinking what a waste some of the classes were. But those classes turned 
out to be the most helpful to me later on. Just hang in there. Give it sometime." (Time won't solve 
my problem. I wish I could tell you. I wish I could just spit it out.) 

"I've given it 10 years of my life! Can you tell me what good 'x plusy' is going to do me as an auto 
mechanic?" 

"An auto mechanic? You've got to be kidding." ( He wouldn't like me if I were an auto mechanic. 
Hewouldn'tlikemeif I didn't finish school. I haveto justify what I said.) 

"No, I'm not. Look at Joe. He's quit school. He's working on cars. And he's making lots of 
money. Now that's practical." 

"It may look that way now. But several years down the road, Joe's going to wish he'd stayed in 
school." (Oh, Boy! here comes lecture number 16 on the value of an education.) "You don't want to 
be an auto mechanic." (How do you know that, Dad? Do you really have any idea what I want?) 
"You need an education to prepare you for something better than that." 

"I don't know. Joe's got a pretty good set-up." (He's not a failure. He didn't finish school and 
he's not a failure.) 

"Look, Son, have you really tried?" (We're beating around the bush, Dad. If you'd just listen, I 
real ly need to tal k to you about somethi ng i mportant.) 

"I've been in high school two years now. Sure I've tried. It's just a waste." 

'That'sa highly respected school, Son. Givethema little credit." (Oh, great. Now we'retalking 
credibility. I wish I could talk about what I want to talk about.) 

"Well, the other guys feel the same way I do." (I have some credibility, too. I'm not a moron.) 

"Do you realize how many sacrifices your mother and I have made to get you where you are?" 
(Uh-oh, here comes the guilt trip. Maybe I am a moron. The school's great, Mom and Dad are great, 
and I'm a moron.) "You can't quit when you've come this far." 

"I know you've sacrificed, Dad. But it's just not worth it." (You just don't understand.) 

"Look, maybe if you spent more time doing your homework and less time in front of TV..." (That's 
not the problem, Dad! That's not it at all! I'll never be able to tel I you. I was dumb to try.) 

"Look, Dad. It's just no good. Oh, never mind! I don't want to talk about this anyway." 

Can you see how limited we are when we try to understand another person on the basis of words 
alone, especially when we're looking at that person through our own glasses? Can you see how 
limiting our autobiographical responses are to a person who is genuinely trying to get us to understand 
his autobiography? 

You will never be able to truly step inside another person, to see the world as he sees it, until you 
develop the pure desire, the strength of personal character, and the positive Emotional Bank Account, 
as well as the empathic listening skillsto do it. 

The ski I Is, the tip of the iceberg of empathic listening, involve four developmental stages 

The first and least effective is to mimic content. This is the skill taught in "active" or "reflective" 
listening. Without the character and relationship base, it is often insulting to people and causes them 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brwcft toyii tyH^Havt 


tocloseup. Itis, however, a first-stage ski 11 because it at least causesyou to listen to what's being said 

Mimicking content is easy. You just listen to the words that come out of someone's mouth and you 
repeat them. You're hardly even using your brain at all 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" 

"You've had it. You think school is for the birds." 

You have essentially repeated back the content of what was being said. You haven't evaluated or 
probed or advised or interpreted. You've at least showed you're paying attention to his words. But 
to understand, you want to do more. 

The second stage of empathic listening isto rephrase the content. It'sa little more effective, but it's 
still limited to the verbal communication 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" 

"You don't want to go to school anymore." 

Thistime, you've put his meaning into your own words. Now you're thinking about what he said, 
mostly with the left side, the reasoning, logical side of the brain. 

Thethird stage brings your right brain into operation. You reflect feeling. 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" 

"You'refeeling really frustrated." 

N ow you're not paying as much attention to what he's saying as you are to the way he feels about 
what he's saying. The fourth stage includes both the second and thethird. You rephrase the content 
and reflect the feeling. 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" 

"You're really frustrated about school." 

Frustration isthefeeling; school isthe content. You're using both sides of your brain to understand 
both sides of his communication. 

Now, what happens when you use fourth stage empathic listening skills is really incredible. As 
you authentically seek to understand, as you rephrase content and reflect feeling, you give him 
psychological air. You also help him work through his own thoughts and feelings. As he grows in 
his confidence of your sincere desire to really listen and understand, the barrier between what's going 
on inside him and what's actually being communicated to you disappears. Itopensasoul-to-soul flow. 
He's not thinking and feeling one thing and communicating another. He begins to trust you with his 
innermost tender feel ings and thoughts. 

"Boy, Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds!" (I want to talk with you to get your attention.) 

"You're really frustrated about school." (That's right! That's how I feel.) 

"I sure am. It's totally impractical. I'm not getting a thing out of it." 

"You feel likeschool's not doing you any good." (Let me think--is that what I mean?) 

"Well, yeah. I'm just not learning anything that's going to help me. I mean, look at Joe. He's 
dropped out of school and he's working on cars. He's making money. Now that's practical." 

"You feel thatjoe really has the right idea." (Well...) 

"Well, I guess he does in a way. He's really making money now. But in a few years I bet he'll 
probably be ticked off at himself." 

"You think Joe's going to feel he made the wrong decision." 

"He's got to. Just look at what he's giving up. I mean, if you don't have an education, you just 
can't make it in this world." 

"Education is really important." 

"Oh, yeah! I mean, if you don't have a diploma, if you can't get jobs or go to college, what are you 
going to do? You've just got to get an education." 

"I t's i important to you r futu re." 

"Itis. And, you know what? I'm really worried. Listen, you won'ttell Mom, will you?" 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


"You don't want your mother to find out." 

"Well, not really. Oh, I guess you can tell her. She'll probably find out anyway. Look, I took this 
test today, this reading test. And, Dad, they said I'm reading on a fourth-grade level. Fourth grade! 
And I'm in junior high school!" 

What a difference real understanding can make! All the well-meaning advice in the world won't 
amount to a hill of beans if we're not even addressing the real problem. And we'll never get to the 
problem if we're so caught up in our own autobiography, our own paradigms, that we don't take off 
our glasses long enough to seethe world from another point of view. 

"I'm going to flunk, Dad. I guess I figure if I'm going to flunk, I might as well quit. But I don't 
want to quit." 

"You feel torn. You're in the middleof a dilemma." 

"What do you think I should do, Dad?" 

By seeking first to understand, this father has just turned a transactional opportunity into a 
transformational opportunity. Instead of interacting on a surface, get-the-job-done level of 
communication, he has created a situation in which he can now have transforming impact, not only on 
his son but also on the relationship. By setting aside his own autobiography and really seeking to 
understand, he has made a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account and has empowered his 
son to open, layer upon layer, and to get to the real issue. 

Now father and son are on the same side of the table looking at the problem, instead of on opposite 
sides looking across at each other. The son is opening his father's autobiography and asking for 
advice. 

Even as the father begins to counsel, however, he needs to be sensitive to his son's communication. 
As long as the response is logical, the father can effectively ask questions and give counsel. But the 
moment the response becomes emotional, he needs to go back to empathic I istening. 

"Well, I can see some things you might want to consider." 

"Like what, Dad?" 

"Like getting some special help with your reading. Maybe they have some kind of tutoring 
program over at the tech school." 

"I've already checked into that. It takes two nights and all day Saturday. That would take so 
much ti me!" 

Sensing emotion in that reply, the father moves back to empathy. 

'That's too much of a price to pay." 

"Besides, Dad, I told the sixth graders I'd be their coach." 

"You don't want to let them down." 

"But I'll tell you this, Dad. If I really thought that tutoring course would help, I'd be down there 
every night. I'd get someone else to coach those kids." 

"You really want the help, but you doubt if the course will make a difference." 

"Do you think it would, Dad?" 

The son is once more open and logical. He's opening his father's autobiography again. Now the 
father has another opportunity to influence and transform. 

There are times when transformation requires no outside counsel. Often when people are really 
given the chance to open up, they unravel their own problems and the solutions become clear to them 
in the process. 

At other times, they really need additional perspective and help. The key is to genuinely seek the 
welfare of the individual, to listen with empathy, to let the person get to the problem and the solution at 
his own pace and time. Layer upon layer - it's like peeling an onion until you get to the soft inner 
core.

When people are really hurting and you really listen with a pure desire to understand, you'll be 
amazed how fast they will open up. They want to open up. Children desperately want to open up, 
even more to their parents than to their peers. And they will, if they feel their parents will love them 
unconditionally and will be faithful to them afterwards and not judge or ridiculethem. 

If you really seek to understand, without hypocrisy and without guile, there will betimes when you 
will be literally stunned with the pure know I edge and understanding that will flow to you from another 
human being. It isn't even always necessary to talk in order to empathize. In fact, sometimes words 
may just get in your way. That's onevery important reason why technique alone will notwork. That 
kind of understanding transcends technique. Isolated techniqueonly gets in the way. 

I have gone through the skills of empathic listening because skill is an important part of any habit. 
We need to have the skills. But let me reiterate that the skills will not be effective unless they come 
from a sincere desire to understand. People resent any attempt to manipulate them. Infact, if you're 
dealing with people you're close to, it's helpful to tell them what you'redoing. 

"I read this book about listening and empathy and I thought about my relationship with you. I 
realized I haven't listened to you I ike I should. Butlwantto. It's hard for me. I may blow it at times, 
but I'm going to work at it. I really care about you and I want to understand. I hope you'll help me." 
Affirming your motive is a huge deposit. 

But if you're not sincere, I wouldn't even try it. It may create an openness and a vulnerability that 
will later turn to your harm when a person discovers that you really didn't care, you really didn't want 
to listen, and he'sleftopen, exposed, and hurt. Thetechnique, the tip of theiceberg, has to come out of 
the massive base of character underneath. 

Now there are people who protest that empathic listening takes too much time. It may take a little 
more time initially but it saves so much time downstream. The most efficient thing you can do if 
you're a doctor and wantto prescribe a wise treatment is to makean accurate diagnosis. You can't say, 
"I'm in too much of a hurry. I don't have time to make a diagnosis. Just take this treatment." 

I remember writing one time in a room on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. There was a soft 
breeze blowing, and so I had opened two windows-- one at the front and one at the side--to keep the 
room cool. I had a number of papers laid out, chapter by chapter, on a large table. 

Suddenly, the breeze started picking up and blowing my papers about. I remember the frantic 
sense of loss I felt because things were no longer in order, including unnumbered pages, and I began 
rushing around the room trying desperately to put them back. Finally, I realized it would be better to 
take 10 seconds and close one of the windows. 

Empathic listening takes time, but it doesn't take anywhere near as much time as it takes to back up 
and correct misunderstandings when you're already miles down the road, to redo, to live with 
unexpressed and unsolved problems, to deal with the results of not giving people psychological air. 

A discerning empathic listener can read what's happening down deep fast, and can show such 
acceptance, such understanding, that other peoplefeel safe to open up layer after layer until they get to 
that soft inner core where the problem really lies. 

People want to be understood. And whatever investment of time it takes to do that will bring 
much greater returns of time as you work from an accurate understanding of the problems and issues 
and from the high Emotional Bank Account that results when a person feels deeply understood. 

Understanding and Perception 

As you learn to listen deeply to other people, you will discover tremendous differences in 
perception. You will also begin to appreciate the impact that these differences can have as people try 
to work together in interdependent situations. 

You see the young woman; I seetheold lady. And both of us can be right. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

You may look at the world through spouse-centered glasses; I may see it through the 
money-centered lens of economic concern. 

You may be scripted in theAbundance Mentality; I may be scripted in the Scarcity Mentality. 

You may approach problems from a highly visual, intuitive, holistic right-brain paradigm; I may be 
very left brain, very sequential, analytical, and verbal in my approach. 

Our perceptions can be vastly different. And yet we both have lived with our paradigms for years, 
thinking they are "facts," and questioning the character or the mental competence of anyone who can't 
"see the facts." 

Now, with all our differences, we're trying to work together -- in a marriage, in a job, in a 
community service project -- to manage resources and accomplish results. So how do we do it? How 
do wetranscend the limits of our individual perceptions so that we can deeply communicate, so that we 
can cooperatively deal with the issues and come up with win-win solutions? 

The answer is Habit 5. It's the first step in the process of win-win. Even if (and especially when) 
the other person is not coming from that paradigm, seek first to understand. 

This principle worked powerfully for one executive who shared with me the foil owing experience. 

"I was working with a small company that was in the process of negotiating a contract with a large 
national banking institution. This institution flew in their lawyers from San Francisco, their negotiator 
from Ohio, and presidents of two of their large banks to create an eight-person negotiating team. The 
company I worked with had decided to go for Win-Win or No Deal. They wanted to significantly 
increase the level of service and the cost, but they had been almost overwhelmed with the demands of 
this large financial institution. 

'The president of our company sat across the negotiating table and told them, 'We would like for 
you to write the contract the way you want it so that we can make sure we understand your needs and 
your concerns. Wewill respond to those needs and concerns. Then we can talk about pricing.' 

'The members of the negotiating team were overwhelmed. They were astounded that they were 
going to have the opportunity to write the contract. They took three days to comeup with theidea. 

"When they presented it, the president said, 'Now let's make sure we understand what you want.' 
And he went down the contract, rephrasing the content, reflecting the feeling, until he was sure and 
they were sure he understood what was important to them. 'Yes. That'sright. No, that's not exactly 
what we meant here...yes, you've got it now.' 

"When he thoroughly understood their perspective, he proceeded to explain some concerns from his 
perspective. . .and they listened. They were ready to listen. They weren't fighting for air. What 
had started out as a very formal, low-trust, almost hostile atmosphere had turned into a fertile 
environment for synergy. 

"At the conclusion of the discussions, the members of the negotiating team basically said, 'We want 
to work with you. We want to do this deal. Just let us know what the price is and we'll sign.'" 

Then Seek to Be U nderstood 

Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood. Knowing how to be understood is the other half 
of Habit 5, and is equally critical in reaching win-win solutions. 

Earlier we defined maturity as the balance between courage and consideration. Seeking to 
understand requires consideration; seeking to be understood takes courage. Win-win requires a high 
degree of both. So it becomes important in interdependent situations for us to beunderstood. 

The early Greeks had a magnificent philosophy which is embodied in three sequentially arranged 
words: ethos, pathos, and logos. I suggest these three words contain the essence of seeking first to 
understand and making effective presentations. 

Ethos is your personal credibility, the faith people have in your integrity and competency. It's the 
trust that you inspire, your Emotional BankAccount. Pathos is the empathic side--it's the feeling. It 
means that you are in alignment with the emotional trust of another person's communication. Logos is 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


the logic, the reasoning part of the presentation. 

Notice the sequence: ethos, pathos, logos -- your character, and your relationships, and then the 
logic of your presentation. This represents another major Paradigm Shift. Most people, in making 
presentations, go straight to the logos, the left-brain logic, of their ideas. They try to convince other 
people of the validity of that logic without first taking ethos and pathos into consideration. 

I had an acquaintance who was very frustrated because his boss was locked into what he felt was an 
unproductive leadership style. 

"Why doesn't he do anything?" he asked me. "I've talked to him about it, he's aware of it, but he 
does nothing." 

"Well, why don't you make an effective presentation?" I asked. 

"I did," was the reply. 

"How do you define 'effective'? Who do they send back to school when the salesman doesn't sell -- 
the buyer? Effective means it works; it means P/ PC. Did you create the change you wanted? Did 
you build the relationship in the process? What were the results of your presentation?" 

"I told you, he didn't do anything. He wouldn't listen." 

'Then make an effective presentation. You've got to empathize with his head. You've got to get 
into his frame of mind. You'regotto makeyour pointsimply and visually and describe the alternative 
he is in favor of better than he can himself. That will take some homework. Are you willing to do 
that?" 

"Why do I have to go through all that?" he asked 

"In other words, you want him to change his whole leadership style and you're not willing to change 
your method of presentation?" 

"I guess so," he replied. 

"Well, then," I said, "just smile about it and learn to live with it." 

"I can't live with it," hesaid. "It compromises my integrity." 

"Okay, then get to work on an effective presentation. That's in your Circleof Influence." 

Intheend, he wouldn't do it. The i nvestment seemed too great. 

Another acquaintance, a university professor, was willing to pay the price. He approached me one 
day and said, "Stephen, I can't get to first base in getting the funding I need for my research because my 
research is really not in the mainstream of this department's interests." 

After discussing his situation at some length, I suggested that he develop an effective presentation 
using ethos, pathos, and logos. "I know you're sincere and the research you want to do would bring 
great benefits. Describe the alternative they are in favor of better than they can themselves. Show 
that you understand them in depth. Then carefully explain the logic behind your request." 

"Well, I'll try," hesaid. 

"Do you want to practice with me?" I asked. He was willing, and so we dress rehearsed his 
approach. 

When he went in to make his presentation, he started by saying, "Now let me see if I first 
understand what your objectives are, and what your concerns are about this presentation and my 
recommendation." 

He took the time to do it slowly, gradually. In the middle of his presentation, demonstrating his 
depth of understanding and respect for their point of view, a senior professor turned to another 
professor, nodded, turned back to him and said, "You'vegot your money." 

When you can present your own ideas clearly, specifically, visually, and most important, 
contextually -- in the context of a deep understanding of their paradigms and concerns -- you 
significantly increase the credibility of your ideas.

You're not wrapped up in your "own thing," delivering grandiose rhetoric from a soapbox. You 
really understand. What you're presenting may even be different from what you had originally 
thought because in your effort to understand, you learned. 

Habit 5 lifts you to greater accuracy, greater integrity, in your presentations. And people know 
that. They know you're presenting the ideas which you genuinely believe, taking all known facts and 
perceptions into consideration, that will benefit everyone. 

One-on-One 

Habit 5 is powerful because it is right in the middle of your Circle of Influence. Many factors in 
interdependent situations are in your Circle of Concern -- problems, disagreements, circumstances, 
other people's behavior. And if you focus your energies out there, you deplete them with little 
positive results. 

But you can always seek first to understand. That's something that's within your control. And as 
you do that, as you focus on your Circleof Influence, you really, deeply understand other people. You 
have accurate information to work with, you get to the heart of matters quickly, you build Emotional 
Bank Accounts, and you give people the psychological air they need so you can work together 
effectively. 

It's the Inside-Out approach. And as you do it, watch what happens to your Circle of Influence. 
Because you really listen, you become inf I uenceable. And being influenceableisthekey to influencing 
others. Your circle begins to expand. You increase your ability to influence many of the things in 
your Circleof Concern. 

And watch what happens to you. The more deeply you understand other people, the more you 
will appreciate them, the more reverent you will feel about them. To touch the soul of another human 
being is to walk on holy ground. 

Habit 5 is something you can practice right now. The next time you communicate with anyone, 
you can put aside your own autobiography and genuinely seek to understand. Even when people 
don't want to open up about their problems, you can be empathic. You can sense their hearts, you can 
sense the hurt, and you can respond, "You seem down today." They may say nothing. That's all right. 
You've shown understanding and respect. 

Don't push; be patient; be respectful. People don't have to open up verbally before you can 
empathize. You can empathize all the time with their behavior. You can bediscerning, sensitive, and 
aware and you can live outside your autobiography when that is needed. 

And if you're highly proactive, you can create opportunities to do preventive work. You don't 
have to wait until your son or daughter has a problem with school or you have your next business 
negotiation to seek first to understand. 

Spend time with your children now, one-on-one. Listen to them; understand them. Look at your 
home, at school life, at the challenges and the problems they're facing, through their eyes. Build the 
Emotional Bank Account. Givethemair. 

Go out with your spouse on a regular basis. Have dinner or do something together you both enjoy. 
Listen to each other; seek to understand. See life through each other's eyes. 

My daily time with Sandra is something I wouldn't trade for anything. As well as seeking to 
understand each other, we often take time to actually practice empathic listening skills to help us in 
communicating with our children. 

We often share our different perceptions of the situation, and we role-play more effective 
approaches to difficult interpersonal family problems. 

I may act as if I am a son or daughter requesting a special privilege even though I haven't fulfilled a 
basicfamily responsibility, and Sandra plays herself

We interact back and forth and try to visualize the situation in a very real way so that we can train 
ourselves to be consistent in modeling and teaching correct principles to our children. Some of our 
most helpful role-plays come from redoing a past d iff i cult or stressful scene in which one of us "blew it." 

The time you invest to deeply understand thepeopleyou love brings tremendous dividends in open 
communication. Many of the problems that plague families and marriages simply don't have time to 
fester and develop. The communication becomes so open that potential problems can be nipped in the 
bud. And there are great reserves of trust in the Emotional Bank Account to handle the problems that 
do arise. 

In business, you can set up one-on-one time with your employees. Listen to them, understand 
them. Set up human resource accounting or Stakeholder Information Systems in your business to get 
honest, accurate feedback at every level: from customers, suppliers, and employees. Make the 
human element as important as the financial or the technical element. You save tremendous amounts 
of ti me, energy, and money w hen you tap i nto the human resources of a busi ness at every I evel. When 
you listen, you learn. And you also give the people who work for you and with you psychological air. 
You inspire loyalty that goes well beyond the eight-to-five physical demands of thejob. 

Seek first to understand. Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, 
before you try to present your own ideas -- seek to understand. It's a powerful habit of effective 
interdependence. 

When we really, deeply understand each other, we open the door to creative solutions and Third 
Alternatives. Our differences are no longer stumbling blocks to communication and progress. 

I nstead, they become the steppi ng stones to synergy. 

Application Suggestions 

1. Select a relationship in which you sense the Emotional Bank Account is in the red. Try to 
understand and write down the situation from the other person's point of view. In your next 
interaction, listen for understanding, comparing what you are hearing with what you wrote down. 
How valid were your assumptions? Did you really understand that individual's perspective. 

2. Share the concept of empathy with someone close to you. Tell him or her you want to work on 
really listening to others and ask for feedback in a week. How did you do? How did it make that 
person feel. 

3. The next ti me you have an opportunity to watch people communicate, cover your ears for a few 
minutes and just watch. What emotions are being communicated that may not come across in words 
alone. 

4. Next time you catch yourself inappropriately using one of the autobiographical responses -- 
probing, evaluating, advising, or interpreting -- try to turn the situation into a deposit by 
acknowledgment and apology. ("I'm sorry, I just realized I'm not really trying to understand. Could 
we start again?") 

5. Base your next presentation on empathy. Describe the other point of view as well as or better 
than its proponents; then seek to have your poi nt understood from thei r frame of reference.

* * 

When Sir Winston Churchill was called to head up the war effort for Great Britain, he remarked that 
all his life had prepared him for this hour. In a similar sense, the exercise of all of the other habits 
prepares us for the habit of synergy. 

When properly understood, synergy is the highest activity in all life -- the true test and 
manifestation of all the other habits put together. 

The highest forms of synergy focus the four unique human endowments, the motive of win-win, 
and the skills of empathic communication on the toughest challenges we face in life. What results is 
almost miraculous. We create new alternatives -- something that wasn't there before. 

Synergy is the essence of Principle-Centered Leadership. It is the essence of principle-centered 
parenting. It catalyzes, unifies, and unleashes the greatest powers within people. All the habits we 
have covered prepare us to create the mi racle of synergy. 

What is synergy? Simply defined, it means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It 
means that the relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself. It is not only a 
part, but the most catalytic, the most empowering, the most unifying, and the most exciting part. 

The creative process is also the most terrifying part because you don't know exactly what's going to 
happen or where it is going to lead. You don't know what new dangers and challenges you'll find. It 
takes an enormous amount of internal security to begin with the spirit of adventure, the spirit of 
discovery, the spirit of creativity. Without doubt, you have to leave the comfort zone of base camp 
and confront an entirely new and unknown wilderness. You become a trailblazer, a pathfinder. You 
open new possibilities, new territories, new continents, so that others can follow. 

Synergy is everywhere in nature. If you plant two plants close together, the roots commingle and 
improve the quality of the soil so that both plants will grow better than if they were separated. If you 
put two pieces of wood together, they will hold much more than the total of the weight held by each 
separately. Thewhole is greater than the sum of its parts. One plus one equals three or more. 

The challenge is to apply the principles of creative cooperation, which we learn from nature, in our 
social interactions. Family life provides many opportunities to observe synergy and to practice it. 

The very way that man and a woman bring a child into the world is synergistic. The essence of 
synergy is to value differences -- to respect them, to build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses. 

We obviously value the physical differences between men and women, husbands and wives. But 
what about the social, mental, and emotional differences? Could these differences not also be sources of 
creating new exciting forms of life-- creating an environment that is truly fulfilling for each person, that 
nurtures the self-esteem and self-worth to each, that creates opportunities for each to mature into 
independence and then gradually into interdependence? Could synergy not create a new script for the 
next generation -- one that is more geared to service and contribution, and is less protective, less 
adversarial, less selfish; one that is more open, more giving, and is less defensive, protective, and 
political; one that is more loving, more caring, and is less possessive and judgmental? 

Synergistic Communication 

When you communicate synergistically, you are simply opening your mind and heart and 
expressions to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options. It may seem as if you are casting aside 
Habit 2 (to Begin with the End in Mind); but, in fact, you're doing the opposite-- you're fulfilling it. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyu tyH^Havt 


You're not sure when you engage in synergistic communication how things will work out or what the 
end will look like, but you do have an inward sense of excitement and security and adventure, believing 
that it will be significantly better than it was before. And that istheend that you havein mind. 

You begin with the belief that parties involved will gain more insight, and that the excitement of that 
mutual learning and insight will create a momentum toward more and more insights, learning, and 
growth. 

Many people have not really experienced even a moderate degree of synergy in their family life or in 
other interactions. They've been trained and scripted into defensive and protective communications or 
into believing that life or other peoplecan't be trusted. As a result, they are never really open to Habit 
6 and to these principles. 

This represents one of the great tragedies and wastes in life, because so much potential remains 
untapped -- completely undeveloped and unused. Ineffective people live day after day with unused 
potential. They experience synergy only in small, peripheral ways in their lives. 

They may have memories of some unusual creative experiences, perhaps in athletics, where they 
were involved in a real team spirit for a period of time. Or perhaps they were in an emergency 
situation where people cooperated to an unusually high degree and submerged ego and pride in an 
effort to save someone's I ife or to produce a solution to a crisis. 

To many, such events may seem unusual, almost out of character with life, even miraculous. But 
this is not so. These things can be produced regularly, consistently, almost daily in people's lives. 
But it requires enormous personal security and openness and a spirit of adventure. 

Almost all creative endeavors are somewhat unpredictable. They often seem ambiguous, 
hit-or-miss, trial and error. And unless people have a high tolerance for ambiguity and get their 
security from integrity to principles and inner values they find it unnerving and unpleasant to be 
involved in highly creative enterprises. Their need for structure, certainty, and predictability is too 
high. 

Synergy in theClassroom 

Asa teacher, I have come to believe that many truly great classes teeter on the very edge of chaos. 
Synergy tests whether teachers and students are really open to the principle of the whole being greater 
than the sum of its parts. 

There are times when neither the teacher nor the student know for sure what's going to happen. In 
the beginning, there's a safe environment that enables peopleto be really open and to learn and to listen 
to each other's ideas. Then comes brainstorming where the spirit of evaluation is subordinated to the 
spirit of creativity, imagining, and intellectual networking. Then an absolutely unusual phenomenon 
begins to take place. The entire class is transformed with the excitement of a new thrust, a new idea, a 
new d i recti on that's hard to defi ne, yet it's al most pal pabl e to the peopl e i nvol ved. 

Synergy is almost as if a group collectively agrees to subordinate old scripts and to write a new one. 

I'll never forget a university class I taughtin leadership philosophy and style. We were about three 
weeks into a semester when, in the middle of a presentation, one person started to relate some very 
powerful personal experiences which were both emotional and insightful. A spirit of humility and 
reverence fell upon the cl ass-- reverence toward this individual and appreciation for his courage. 

This spirit became fertile soil for a synergistic and creative endeavor. Others began to pick up on it, 
sharing some of their experiences and insights and even some of their self-doubts. The spirit of trust 
and safety prompted many to become extremely open. Rather than present what they prepared, they 
fed on each other's insights and ideas and started to create a whole new scenario as to what that class 
could mean. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


I was deeply involved in the process. In fact, I was almost mesmerized by it because it seemed so 
magical and creative. And I found myself gradually loosening up my commitment to the structure of 
the class and sensing entirely new possibilities. It wasn't just a flight of fancy; there was a sense of 
maturity and stability and substance which transcended by far the old structure and plan. 

We abandoned the old syllabus, the purchased textbooks, and all the presentation plans, and we set 
up new purposes and projects and assignments. We became so excited about what was happening 
that in about three more weeks, we all sensed an overwhelming desire to share what was happening 
with others 

We decided to write a book containing our learnings and insights on the subject of our study -- 
principles of leadership. Assignments were changed, new projects undertaken, new teams formed. 
People worked much harder than they ever would have in the original class structure, and for an 
entirely different set of reasons 

Out of this experience emerged an extremely unique, cohesive, and synergistic culture that did not 
end with the semester. For years, alumni meetings were held among members of that class. Even 
today, many years later, when we see each other, we talk about it and often attempt to describe what 
happened and why. 

One of the interesting things to me was how little time had transpired before there was sufficient 
trust to create such synergy. I think it was largely because the people were relatively mature. They 
were in the final semester of their senior year, and I think they wanted more than just another good 
classroom experience. They were hungry for something new and exciting, something that they could 
create that was truly meaningful. It was "an idea whose time had come" for them. In addition, the 
chemistry was right. I felt that experiencing synergy was more powerful than talking about it, that 
producing something new was more meaningful than simply reading something old. 

I've also experienced, as I believe most people have, times that were almost synergistic, times that 
hung on the edge of chaos and for some reason descended into it. Sadly, people who are burned by 
such experiences often begin their next new experience with that failure in mind. They defend 
themselves agai nst it and cut themselves off from synergy. 

It's like administrators who set up new rules and regulations based on the abuses of a few people 
inside an organization, thus limiting the freedom and creative possibilities for many -- or business 
partners who imagine the worst scenarios possible and write them up in legal language, killing the 
whole spirit of creativity, enterprise, and synergistic possibility. 

As I think back on many consulting and executive education experiences, I can say that the 
highlights were almost always synergistic. There was usually an early moment that required 
considerable courage, perhaps in becoming extremely authentic, in confronting some insidetruth about 
the individual or the organization or the family which really needed to be said, but took a combination 
of considerable courage and genuine love to say it. Then others became more authentic, open, and 
honest, and the synergistic communication process began. It usually became more and more creative, 
and ended up in insights and plans that no one had anticipated initially. 

As Carl Rogers taught, 'That which is most personal is most general." The more authentic you 
become, the more genuine in your expression, particularly regarding personal experiences and even 
self-doubts, the more people can relate to your expression and the safer it makes them feel to express 
themselves. That expression in turn feeds back on the other person's spirit, and genuine creative 
empathy takes place, producing new insights and learnings and a sense of excitement and adventure 
that keeps the process goi ng. 

People then begin to interact with each other almost in half sentences, sometimes incoherently, but 
they get each other's meanings very rapidly. Then whole new worlds of insights, new perspectives, 
new paradigms that insure options, new alternatives are opened up and thought about. Though 
occasionally these new ideas are left up in the air, they usually come to some kind of closure that is 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


practical and useful. 

Synergy in Business 

I enjoyed one particularly meaningful synergistic experience as I worked with my associates to 
create the corporate mission statement for our business. Almost all members of the company went 
high up into the mountains where, surrounded by the magnificence of nature, we began with a first 
draft of what some of us considered to be an excel lent mission statement. 

At first the communication was respectful, careful and predictable. But as we began to talk about 
the various alternatives, possibilities, and opportunities ahead, people became very open and authentic 
and simply started to think out loud. The mission statement agenda gave way to a collective free 
association, a spontaneous piggybacking of ideas. People were genuinely empathic as well as 
courageous, and we moved from mutual respect and understanding to creative synergistic 
communication. 

Everyone could sense it. It was exciting. As it matured, we returned to the task of putting the 
evolved collective vision into words, each of which contains specific and committed-to meaning for 
each participant. 

The resulting corporate mission statement reads: 

Our Mission is to empower people and organizations to significantly increase their performance 
capability in order to achieve worthwhile purposes through understanding and living 
Principle-Centered Leadership. 

The synergistic process that led to the creation of our mission statement engraved it in all the hearts 
and minds of everyone there, and it has served us well as a frame of reference of what we are about, as 
wel I as what we are not about. 

Another high-level synergy experience took place when I accepted an invitation to serve as the 
resource and discussion catalyst at the annual planning meeting of a large insurance company. Several 
months ahead, I met with the committee responsible to prepare for and stage the two-day meeting 
which was to involve all the top executives. They informed me that the traditional pattern was to 
identify four or five major issues through questionnaires and interviews, and to have alternative 
proposals presented by the executives. Past meetings had been generally respectful exchanges, 
occasionally deteriorating into defensive win-lose ego battles. They were usually predictable, 
uncreative, and boring. 

As I talked with the committee members about the power of synergy, they could sense its potential. 
With considerable trepidation, they agreed to change the pattern. They requested various executives 
to prepare anonymous "white papers" on each of the high priority issues, and then asked all the 
executives to immerse themselves in these papers ahead of time in order to understand the issues and 
the differing points of view. They were to come to the meeting prepared to listen rather than to 
present, prepared to create and synergize rather than to defend and protect. 

We spent the first half-day in the meeting teaching the principles and practicing the ski I Is of Habits 4, 
5, and 6. The rest of the time was spent in creative synergy. 

The release of creative energy was incredible. Excitement replaced boredom. People became very 
open to each other's influence and generated new insights and options. By the end of the meeting an 
entirely new understanding of the nature of the central company challenge evolved. The white paper 
proposals became obsolete. Differences were valued and transcended. A new common vision began 
to form. 

Once people have experienced real synergy, they are never quite the same again. They know the 
possibility of having other such mind-expanding adventures in the future. 

Often attempts are madeto recreate a particular synergistic experience, but this seldom can be done. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


However, the essential purpose behind creative work can be recaptured. Like the Far Eastern 
philosophy, "We seek not to imitate the masters, rather we seek what they sought," we seek not to 
imitate past creative synergistic experiences, rather we seek new ones around new and different and 
sometimes higher purposes. 

Snergy and Communication 

Synergy is exciting. Creativity is exciting. It's phenomenal what openness and communication 
can produce. The possibilities of truly significant gain, of significant improvement are so real that it's 
worth the risk such openness entails. 

After World War II, the United States commissioned David Lilienthal to head the new Atomic 
Energy Commission. Lilienthal brought together a group of people who were highly influential -- 
celebrities in their own right -- disciples, as it were, of their own frames of reference. 

This very diverse group of individuals had an extremely heavy agenda, and they were impatient to 
get at it. In addition, the press was pushing them. 

But Lilienthal took several weeks to create a high Emotional Bank Account. He had these people 
get to know each other -- their interests, their hopes, their goals, their concerns, their backgrounds, their 
frames of reference, their paradigms. He facilitated the kind of human interaction that creates a great 
bonding between people, and he was heavily criticized for taking the time to do it because it wasn't 
"efficient." 

But the net result was that this group became closely knit together, very open with each other, very 
creative, and synergistic. The respect among the members of the commission was so high that if there 
was disagreement, instead of opposition and defense, there was a genuine effort to understand. The 
attitude was "If a person of your intelligence and competence and commitment disagrees with me, then 
there must be something to your disagreement that I don't understand, and I need to understand it. 
You have a perspective, a frame of reference I need to look at." Nonprotective interaction developed, 
and an unusual culturewas born. 

Thefollowing diagram illustrates how closely trust is related to different levels of communication. 

The lowest level of communication coming out of low-trust situations would be characterized by 
defensiveness, protectiveness, and often legalistic language, which covers all the bases and spells out 
qualifiers and the escape clauses in the event things go sour. Such communication produces only 
win-lose or lose-lose. It isn't effective -- there's no P/ PC Balance -- and it creates further reasons to 
defend and protect. 

The middle position is respectful communication. This is the level where fairly mature people 
interact. They have respect for each other, but they want to avoid the possibility of ugly confrontations, 
so they communicate politely but not empathically. They might understand each other intellectually, 
but they really don't deeply look at the paradigms and assumptions underlying their own opinions and 
become open to new possi bi I ities. 

Respectful communication works in independent situations and even in interdependent situations, 
but the creative possibilities are not opened up. In interdependent situations compromise is the 
position usually taken. Compromise means that 1 + 1 + 1= 1/2. Both give and take. The 
communication isn't defensive or protective or angry or manipulative; it is honest and genuine and 
respectful. But it isn't creative or synergistic. It produces a low form of win-win. 

Synergy means that 1+1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600. The synergistic position of high trust 
produces solutions better than any originally proposed, and all parties know it. Furthermore, they 
genuinely enjoy the creative enterprise. A miniculture is formed to satisfy in and of itself. Even if it 
is short-lived, the P/ PC Balance is there. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


There are some circumstances in which synergy may not be achievable and no deal isn't viable. But 
even in these circumstances, the spirit of sincere trying will usually result in a more effective 
compromise. 

Fishing for the A Third Alternative 

To get a better idea of how our level of communication affects our interdependent effectiveness, 
envision the foil owing scenario. 

It's vacation time, and a husband wants to take his family out to the lake country to enjoy camping 
and fishing. This is important to him; he's been planning it all year. He's made reservations at a 
cottage on the lake and arranged to rent a boat, and his sons are really excited about going. 

His wife, however, wants to use the vacation time to visit her ailing mother some 250 miles away. 
She doesn't have the opportunity to see her very often, and this is important to her 

Their differences could be the cause of a major negative experience. 

'The plans are set. The boys are excited. Weshould go on the fishing trip," he says. 

"But we don't know how much longer my mother will be around, and I want to be by her," she 
replies. "This isour only opportunity to have enough time to do that." 

"All year long we've looked forward to this one-week vacation. The boys would be miserable 
sitting around grandmother's house for a week. They'd drive everybody crazy. Besides, your 
mother's not that sick. A nd she has your sister less than a mile away to take care of her." 

"She's my mother, too. I want to be with her." 

"You could phone her every night. And we're planning to spend time with her at the Christmas 
family reunion. Remember?" 

'That's not for five more months. We don't even know if she'll still be here by then. Besides, she 
needs me, and she wants me." 

"She's being well taken careof. Besides, the boys and I need you, too." 

"My mother is more i important than fishing." 

"Your husband and sons are more i mportant than your mother." 

As they disagree, back and forth, they finally may come up with some kind of compromise. They 
may decide to split up -- he takes the boys fishing at the lake while she visits her mother. And they 
both feel guilty and unhappy. The boys sense it, and it affects their enjoyment of the vacation. 

The husband may give in to his wife, but he does it grudgingly. And consciously or unconsciously, 
he produces evidence to fulfil I his prophecy of how miserable the week will be for everyone. 

The wife may give in to her husband, but she's withdrawn and overreactive to any new 
developments in her mother's health situation. If her mother were to become seriously ill and die, the 
husband could never forgive himself, and shecouldn'tforgivehim either. 

Whatever compromise they finally agree on, it could be rehearsed over the years as evidence of 
insensitivity, neglect, or a bad priority decision on either part. It could be a source of contention for 
years and could even polarize the family. Many marriages that once were beautiful and soft and 
spontaneous and loving have deteriorated to the level of a hostility through a series of incidents just like 
this. 

The husband and wife see the situation differently. And that difference can polarize them, separate 
them, create wedges in the relationship. Or it can bring them closer together on a higher level. If 
they have cultivated the habits of effective interdependence, they approach their differences from an 
entirely different paradigm. Their communication is on a higher level. 

Because they have a high Emotional Bank Account, they have trust and open communication in 
their marriage. Because they Think Win-Win, they believe in a Third Alternative, a solution that is 
mutually beneficial and is better than what either of them originally proposed. Because they listen 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


empathically and seek first to understand, they create within themselves and between them a 
comprehensive picture of the values and the concerns that need to be taken into account in making a 
decision. 

And the combination of those ingredients -- the high Emotional Bank Account, thinking win-win, 
and seeking first to understand -- creates the ideal environment for synergy. 

Buddhism calls this "the middle way." Middle in this sense does not mean compromise; it means 
higher, I ike the apex of the triangle. 

In searching for the "middle" or higher way, this husband and wife realize that their love, their 
relationship, is part of their synergy 

As they communicate, the husband really, deeply feels his wife's desire, her need to be with her 
mother. He understands how she wants to relieve her sister, who has had the primary responsibility 
for their mother's care. He understands that they really don't know how long she will be with them, 
and that she certainly is more i important than fishing. 

And the wife deeply understands her husband's desire to have the family together and to provide a 
great experience for the boys. She realizes the investment that has been made in lessons and 
equipment to prepare for this fishing vacation, and she feels the importance of creating good memories 
with them. 

So they pool those desi res. A nd they're not on opposite sides of the problem. They're together on 
one side, looking at the problem, understanding the needs, and working to create a Third Alternative 
that will meet them. 

"Maybe we could arrange another time within the month for you to visit with your mother," he 
suggests. "I could take over the home responsibilities for the weekend and arrange for some help at 
the first of the week so that you could go. I know it's important to you to have that time. 

"Or maybe we could locate a place to camp and fish that would be close to your mother. The area 
wouldn't be as nice, but we could still be outdoors and meet other needs as well. And the boys 
wouldn't be climbing the walls. We could even plan some recreational activities with the cousins, 
aunts, and uncles, which would bean added benefit." 

They synergize. They communicate back and forth until they come up with a solution they both 
feel good about. It's better than the solutions either of them originally proposed. It's better than 
compromise. It'sasynergisticsolutionthatbuildsP and PC. 

Instead of a transaction, it's a transformation. They get what they both really want and build their 
relationship in the process. 

Negative Synergy 

Seeking the Third Alternative is a major Paradigm Shift from the dichotomous, either/ or mentality. 
But look at the difference in results. 

How much negative energy is typically expended when people try to solve problems or make 
decisions in an interdependent reality? How much time is spent in confessing other people's sins, 
politicking, rivalry, interpersonal conflict, protecting one's backside, masterminding, and second 
guessing? It's like trying to drive down the road with one foot on the gas and the other foot on the 
brake. 

And instead of getting a foot off the brake, most people give it more gas. They try to apply more 
pressure, more eloquence, more logical information to strengthen their position. 

The problem is that highly dependent people are trying to succeed in an interdependent reality. 
They're either dependent on borrowing strength from position power and they go for win-lose or 
they're dependent on being popular with others and they go for lose-win. They may talk win-win 
technique, but they don't really want to listen; they want to manipulate. And synergy can't thrive in 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


that environment. 

Insecure people think that all reality should be amenable to their paradigms. They have a high 
need to clone others, to mold them over into their own thinking. They don't realize that the very 
strength of the relationship is in having another point of view. Sameness is not oneness; uniformity is 
not unity. Unity, or oneness, is complementariness, not sameness. Sameness is uncreative...and 
boring. The essence of synergy isto valuethe differences. 

I've come to believe that the key to interpersonal synergy is intrapersonal synergy, that is synergy 
within ourselves. The heart of interpersonal synergy is embodied in the principles in the first three 
habits, which give the internal security sufficient to handle the risks of being open and vulnerable. By 
internalizing those principles, we develop the Abundance Mentality of win-win and the authenticity of 
Habit 5. 

One of the very practical results of being principle-centered is that it makes us whole -- truly 
integrated. People who are scripted deeply in logical, verbal, left-brain thinking will discover how 
totally inadequate that thinking is in solving problems which require a great deal of creativity. They 
become aware and begin to open up a new script inside their right brain. It's not that the right brain 
wasn't there; it just lay dormant. The muscles had not been developed, or perhaps they had atrophied 
after early childhood because of the heavy left-brain emphasis of formal education or social scripting. 

When a person has access to both the intuitive, creative, and visual right brain, and the analytical, 
logical, verbal left brain, then the whole brain is working. In other words, there is psychic synergy 
taking place in our own head. And this tool is best suited to the reality of what life is, because life is 
not just logical -- it is also emotional. 

One day I was presenting a seminar which I titled, "Managefrom the Left, Lead from the Right" to a 
company in Orlando, Florida. During the break, the president of the company came up to me and said, 
"Stephen, this is intriguing. But I have been thinking about this material more in terms of its 
application to my marriage than to my business. My wife and I have a real communication problem. 

I wonder if you would have lunch with the two of us and just kind of watch how wetalkto each other? 

"Let'sdo it," I replied. 

As we sat down together, we exchanged a few pleasantries. Then this man turned to his wife and 
said, "Now, honey, I've invited Stephen to have lunch with us to see if he could help us in our 
communication with each other. I know you feel I should be a more sensitive, considerate husband. 
Could you give me something specific you think I ought to do?" H is dominant left brain wanted facts, 
figures, specifics, parts. 

"Well, as I've told you before, it's nothing specific. It's more of a general sense I have about 
priorities." Her dominant right brain was dealing with sensing and with the gestalt, the whole, the 
relationship between the parts. 

"What do you mean, 'a general feeling about priorities'? What is it you want me to do? Give me 
something specific I can get a hand I eon." 

"Well, it's just a feeling." Her right brain was dealing in images, intuitive feelings. "I just don't think 
our marriage is as important to you as you tel I me it is." 

"Well, what can I do to make it more important? Give me something concrete and specific to go on." 

"It's hard to put into words." 

At that point, he just rolled his eyes and looked at me as if to say, "Stephen, could you endure this 
kind of dumbness in your marriage?" 

"It's just a feeling," she said, "a very strong feeling." 

"Honey," he said to her, "that's your problem. And that's the problem with your mother. In fact, 
it's the problem with every woman I know." 

Then he began to interrogate her as though it were some kind of legal deposition. 

"Do you live where you want to live?" 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Hairt 


'That's not it," she sighed. "That's not it at all." 

"I know," he replied with aforced patience. "But si nee you won't tell me exactly what it is, I figure 
thebest way to find outwhatitis istofind out what it is not. Do you live where you want to live?" 

"I guess." 

"Honey, Stephen's here for just a few minutes to try to help us. Just give me a quick 'yes' or 'no' 
answer. Do you live where you want to live?" 

"Yes." 

"Okay. That's settled. Do you have the things you want to have?" 

"Yes." 

"All right. Do you do the things you wanttodo?" 

This went on for a little while, and I could see I wasn't helping at all. So I intervened and said, "Is 
this kind of how it goes in your relationship?" 

"Every day, Stephen," he replied. 

"It's the story of our marriage," she sighed. 

I looked at the two of them and the thought crossed my mind that they were two half-brained 
people living together. "Do you have any children?" I asked. 

"Yes, two." 

"Really?" I asked incredulously. "How did you do it?" 

"What do you mean how did we do it?" 

"You were synergistic!" I said. "One plus one usually equals two. But you made one plus one 
equal four. N ow that's synergy. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. So how did you do 
it?" 

"You know how we did it," he replied. 

"You must have valued the differences!" I exclaimed. 

V al u i ng the D ifferences 

Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy -- the mental, the emotional, the psychological 
differences between people. And the key to valuing those differences is to realize that all people see 
the world, not as it is, but as they are. 

If I think I seetheworld as it is, why would I want to value the differences? Why would I even want 
to bother with someone who's "off track"? My paradigm is that I am objective; I see the world as it is. 
Everyone else is buried by the minutia, but I see the larger picture. That's why they call me a 
supervisor--1 have super vision. 

If that's my paradigm, then I will never be effectively interdependent, or even effectively 
independent, for that matter. I will be limited by the paradigms of my own conditioning. 

The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual 
limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds 
of other human beings. That person values the differences because those differences add to his 
knowledge, to his understanding of reality. When we're left to our own experiences, we constantly 
suffer from a shortage of data. 

Is it logical that two peoplecan disagree and that both can be right? It's not logical: it's psychological. 
And it's very real. You see the young lady; I see the old woman. We're both looking at the same 
picture, and both of us are right. We see the same black lines, the same white spaces. But we 
interpret them differently because we've been conditioned to interpret them differently. 

And unless we value the differences in our perceptions, unless we value each other and give 
credence to the possibility that we're both right, that life is not always a dichotomous either/ or, that 
there are almost always Third Alternatives, we will never be able to transcend the limits of that 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


conditioning. 

All I may see is the old woman. But I realize that you see something else. And I value you. I 
valueyour perception. I wantto understand. 

So when I become aware of the difference in our perceptions, I say, "Good! You see it differently! 
H el p me see what you see." 

If two people have the same opinion, one is unnecessary. It's not going to do me any good at all to 
communicate with someone else who sees only the old woman also. I don't want to talk, to 
communicate, with someone who agrees with me; I want to communicate with you because you see it 
differently. I valuethatdifference. 

By doing that, I not only increase my own awareness; I also affirm you. I give you psychological 
air. I take my foot off the brake and release the negative energy you may have invested in defending a 
particular position. I create an environment for synergy. 

The importance of valuing the difference is captured in an often-quoted fable called 'The Animal 
School," written by educator Dr. R. H. Reeves. 

Once upon a time, the animals decided they must do something heroic to meet the problems of a 
"New World," so they organized a school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running, 
climbing, swimming, and flying. To make it easier to administer, all animalstook all the subjects. 

Theduck was excellent in swimming, better in fact than his instructor, and madeexcellent grades in 
flying, but he was very poor in running. Since he was low in running he had to stay after school and 
also drop swimming to practice running. This was kept up until his web feet were badly worn and he 
was only average in swimming. But average was acceptable in school, so nobody worried about that 
except theduck. 

The rabbit started at the top of the class in running, but had a nervous breakdown because of so 
much makeup in swimming. 

The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustrations in the flying class where his 
teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the tree-top down. He also developed 
Charley horses from over-exertion and he got a C in climbing and a D in running. 

The eagle was a problem child and had to be disciplined severely. In climbing class he beat all the 
others to the top of the tree, butinsisted on using his own way of getting there. 

At the end of the year, an abnormal eel that could swim exceedingly well and also could run, climb 
and fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian. 

The prairiedogs stayed out of school and fought the tax levy because the administration would not 
add digging and burrowing to the curriculum. They apprenticed their children to the badger and later 
joined thegroundhogs and gophers to start a successful private school. 

Force Field Analysis 

In an interdependent situation, synergy is particularly powerful in dealing with negative forces that 
work against growth and change. 

Sociologist Kurt Lewin developed a "Force Field Analysis" model in which he described any current 
level of performance or being as a state of equilibrium between the driving forces that encourage 
upward movement and the restraining forces that discourage it. 

Driving forces generally are positive, reasonable, logical, conscious, and economic. In juxtaposition, 
restraining forces are often negative, emotional, illogical, unconscious, and social/ psychological. Both 
sets of forces are very real and must betaken into account in dealing with change. 

In a family, for example, you have a certain "climate" in the home -- a certain level of positive or 
negative interaction, of feeling safe or unsafein expressing feelings or talking about concerns, of respect 
or disrespect in communication among family members. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


You may really want to change that level. You may want to create a climate that is more positive, 
more respectful, more open and trusting. Your logical reasons for doing that are the driving forces 
that act to raisethe level.. 

But increasing those driving forces is not enough. Your efforts are opposed by restraining forces -- 
by the competitive spirit between children in the family, by the different scripting of home life you and 
your spouse have brought to the relationship, by habits that have developed in the family, by work or 
other demands on your time and energies. 

Increasing the driving forces may bring results -- for a while. But as long as the restraining forces 
are there, it becomes increasingly harder. It's like pushing against a spring: the harder you push, the 
harder it is to push until the force of the spring suddenly thrusts the level back down. 

The resulting up and down, yo-yo effect causes you to feel, after several attempts, that people are 
"just the way they are" and that "it's too difficult to change." 

But when you introduce synergy, you use the motive of Habit 4, the skill of Habit 5, and the 
interaction of Habit 6 to work directly on the restraining forces. You unfreeze them, loosen them up, 
and create new insights that actually transform those restraining forces into driving ones. You involve 
people in the problem, immerse them in it, so that they soak it in and feel it is their problem and they 
tend to become an i important part of the solution. 

Asa result, new goals, shared goals, are created, and the whole enterprise moves upward, often in 
ways that no one could have anticipated. And the excitement contained within that movement creates 
a new culture. The people involved in it are enmeshed in each other's humanity and empowered by 
new, fresh thinking, by new creative alternatives and opportunities. 

I've been involved several times in negotiations between people who were angry at each other and 
hired lawyers to defend their positions. And all that did was to exacerbate the problem because the 
interpersonal communication deteriorated as it went through the legal process. But the trust level was 
so low that the parties felt they had no other alternative than to take the issues to court. 

"Would you be interested in going for a win-win solution that both parties feel really good about?" I 
would ask. 

The response w as u su al I y aff i r mati ve, but most peopledidn'treallythinkitwas possi bl e. 

"If I can get the other party to agree, would you be willing to start the process of really 
communicating with each other?" 

Agai n, the answer was usual ly "yes." 

The results in almost every case have been astounding. Problems that had been legally and 
psychologically wrangled about for months have been settled in a matter of a few hours or days. M ost 
of the solutions weren't the courthouse compromise solutions either; they were synergistic, better than 
the solutions proposed independently by either party. And, in most cases, the relationships continued 
even though it had appeared in the beginning that the trust level was so low and the rupture in the 
relationship so large as to be almost irreparable. 

At one of our development programs, an executive reported a situation where a manufacturer was 
being sued by a longtime industrial customer for lack of performance. Both parties felt totally justified 
in the rightness of their position and perceived each other as unethical and completely untrustworthy. 

As they began to practice Habit 5, two things became clear. First, early communication problems 
resulted in a misunderstanding which was later exacerbated by accusations and counteraccusations. 
Second, both were initially acting in good faith and didn't like the cost and hassle of a legal fight, but 
saw no other way out. 

Once these two things became clear, the spirit of Habits 4, 5, and 6 took over, the problem was 
rapidly resolved, and the relationship continues to prosper. 

In another circumstance, I received an early morning phone call from a land developer desperately 
searching for help. The bank wanted to foreclose because he was not complying with the principal 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


and interest payment schedule, and he was suing the bank to avoid the foreclosure. He needed 
additional funding to finish and market the land so that he could repay the bank, but the bank refused 
to provide additional funds until scheduled payments were met. It was a chicken-and-egg problem 
with undercapitalization. 

In the meantime, the project was languishing. The streets were beginning to look like weed fields, 
and the owners of the few homes that had been built were up in arms as they saw their property values 
drop. The city was also upset over the "prime land" project falling behind schedule and becoming an 
eyesore. Tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs had already been spent by the bank and the 
developer and the case wasn't scheduled to come to court for several months. 

In desperation, this developer reluctantly agreed to try the principles of Habits 4, 5, and 6. He 
arranged a meeting with even more reluctant bank officials. 

The meeting started at 8 A.M. in one of the bank conference rooms. The tension and mistrust 
were palpable. The attorney for the bank had committed the bank officials to say nothing. They were 
only to listen and he alone would speak. He wanted nothing to happen that would compromise the 
bank's position in court. 

For the first hour and a half, I taught Habits 4, 5, and 6. At 9:301 went to the blackboard and wrote 
down the bank's concerns based on our prior understanding. Initially the bank officials said nothing, 
but the more we communicated win-win intentions and sought first to understand, the more they 
opened up to explain and clarify. 

As they began to feel understood, the whole atmosphere changed and a sense of momentum, of 
excitement over the prospect of peacefully settling the problem was clearly evident. Over the 
attorney's objections the bank officials opened up even more, even about personal concerns. "When 
we walk out of here the first thing the bank president will say is, 'Did we get our money?' What are we 
going to say?" 

By 11:00, the bank officers were still convinced of their rightness, but they felt understood and were 
no longer defensive and officious. Atthat point, they were sufficiently open to listen to the developer's 
concerns, which we wrote down on the other side of the blackboard. This resulted in deeper mutual 
understanding and a collective awareness of how poor early communication had resulted in 
misunderstanding and unrealistic expectations, and how continuous com muni cation in a win-win spirit 
could have prevented the subsequent major problems from developing. 

The shared sense of both chronic and acute pain combined with a sense of genuine progress kept 
everyone communicating. By noon, when the meeting was scheduled to end, the people were positive, 
creative, and synergistic and wanted to keep talking. 

The very first recommendation made by the developer was seen as a beginning win-win approach 
by all. It wassynergized on and improved, and at 12:45 P.M. the developer and the two bank officers 
left with a plan to present together to the H ome Owners' Association and the city. Despite subsequent 
complicating developments, the legal fight was aborted and the building project continued to a 
successful conclusion. 

I am not suggesting that people should not use legal processes. Some situations absolutely require 
it. But I see it as a court of last, not first, resort. If it is used too early, even in a preventive sense, 
sometimes fear and the legal paradigm create subsequent thought and action processes that are not 
synergistic. 

All Nature is Synergistic 

Ecology is a word which basically describes the synergism in nature -- everything is related to 
everything else. It's in the relationship that creative powers are maximized, just as the real power in 
these Seven Habits is in their relationship to each other, not just in the individual habits themselves. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


The relationship of the parts is also the power in creating a synergistic culture inside a family or an 
organization. The more genuine the involvement, the more sincere and sustained the participation in 
analyzing and solving problems, the greater the release of everyone's creativity, and of their 
commitment to what they create. This, I'm convinced, is the essence of the power in the Japanese 
approach to business, which has changed the world marketplace. 

Synergy works; it's a correct principle. It is the crowning achievement of all the previous habits. 
It is effectiveness in an interdependent reality -- it is teamwork, team building, the development of 
unity and creativity with other human beings. 

Although you cannot control the paradigms of others in an interdependent interaction or the 
synergistic process itself, a great deal of synergy is within your Circle of Influence. 

Your own internal synergy is completely within the circle. You can respect both sides of your own 
nature -- the analytical side and the creative side. You can value the difference between them and use 
that d i fference to catal yze creati vi ty. 

You can be synergistic within yourself even in the midst of a very adversarial environment. You 
don't have to take insults personally. You can sidestep negative energy; you can look for the good in 
others and utilize that good, as different as it may be, to improve you point of view and to enlarge your 
perspective. 

You can exercise the courage in interdependent situations to be open, to express your ideas, your 
feelings, and your experiences in away that will encourage other peopleto be open also. 

You can value the difference in other people. When someone disagrees with you, you can say, 
"Good! You see it differently." You don't have to agree with them; you can simply affirm them. And 
you can seek to understand. 

When you see only two alternatives -- yours and the "wrong" one -- you can look for a synergistic 
Third Alternative. There's almost always a Third Alternative, and if you work with a win-win 
philosophy and really seek to understand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for 
everyone concerned. 

Application Suggestions 

1. Think about a person who typically sees things differently than you do. Consider ways in 
which those differences might be used as stepping-stones to Third Alternative solutions. Perhaps you 
could seek out his or her views on a current project or problem, valuing the different views you are 
likely to hear. 

2. Make a list of people who irritate you. Do they represent different views that could lead to 
synergy if you had greater intrinsic security and valued the differences. 

3. Identify a situation in which you desire greater teamwork and synergy. What conditions 
would need to exist to support synergy? What can you do to create those conditions. 

4. The next time you have a disagreement or confrontation with someone, attempt to understand 
the concerns underlying that person's position. Address those concerns in a creative and mutually 
beneficial way.

Part Four-RENEWAL 


Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw TM 

Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal 

Sometimes when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things.... I am 
tempted to think...there are no little things. 

- Bruce Barton 

* * 

Suppose you were to come upon someone in the woods working feverishly to saw down a tree. 

"What are you doing?" you ask. 

"Can't you see?" comes the impatient reply. "I'm sawing down thistree." 

"You look exhausted!" you exclaim. "How long have you been at it?" 

"Over five hours," he returns, "and I'm beat! This is hard work." 

"Well, why don't you take a break for a few minutes and sharpen the saw?" you inquire. "I'm sure 
it would go a lot faster." 

"I don't have time to sharpen the saw," the man says emphatically. "I'm too busy sawing!" 

Habit 7 is taking time to Sharpen the Saw. It surrounds the other habits on the Seven Habits 
paradigm because it isthe habit that makes all the others possible. 

Four D imensions of Renewal 

Habit 7 is personal PC. It's preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have -- you. It's 
renewing thefour dimensions of your nature-- physical, spiritual, mental, and social/ emotional. 

Although different words are used, most philosophies of life deal either explicitly or implicitly with 
these four dimensions. Philosopher Herb Shepherd describes the healthy balanced life around four 
values: perspective (spiritual), autonomy (mental), connectedness (social), and tone (physical). George 
Sheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: being a good animal (physical), a good craftsman 
(mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiritual). Sound motivation and organization theory 
embrace these four dimensions or motivations -- the economic (physical); how people are treated 
(social); how people are developed and used (mental); and the service, the job, the contribution the 
organization gives (spiritual). 

"Sharpen the Saw" basically means expressing all four motivations. It means exercising all four 
dimensions of our nature, regularly and consistently, in wise and balanced ways. 

To do this, we must be proactive. Taking time to sharpen the saw is a definite Quadrant II activity, 
and Quadrant II must be acted on. Quadrant I, because of its urgency, acts on us; it presses upon us 
constantly. Personal PC must be pressed upon until it becomes second nature, until it becomes a kind 
of healthy addiction. Because it's at the center of our Circle of Influence, no one else can do it for us. 
We must do it for ourselves. 

This is the single most powerful investment we can ever make in life -- investment in ourselves, in 
the only instrument we have with which to deal with life and to contribute. We arethe instruments of 
our own performance, and to be effective, weneed to recognize the importance of taking time regularly 
to sharpen the saw in all four ways. 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


The Physical Dimension 

The physical dimension involves caring effectively for our physical body -- eating the right kinds of 
foods, getting sufficient rest and relaxation, and exercising on a regular basis. 

Exercise is one of those Quadrant II, high-leverage activities that most of us don't do consistently 
because it isn't urgent. And because we don't do it, sooner or later we find ourselves in Quadrant I, 
dealing with the health problems and crises that come as a natural result of our neglect. 

Most of us think we don't have enough time to exercise. What a distorted paradigm! We don't have 
time not to. We're talking about three to six hours a week -- or a minimum of thirty minutes a day, 
every other day. That hardly seems an inordinate amount of time considering the tremendous benefits 
in terms of the impact on the other 162-165 hours of the week. 

And you don't need any special equipment to do it. If you want to go to a gym or a spa to use the 
equipment or enjoy some skill sports such as tennis or racquetball, that's an added opportunity. But it 
isn't necessary to sharpen the saw. 

A good exercise program is one that you can do in your own home and one that will build your 
body in three areas: endurance, flexibility, and strength. 

Endurance comes from aerobic exercise, from cardiovascular efficiency -- the ability of your heart to 
pump blood through your body. 

Although the heart is a muscle, it cannot be exercised directly. It can only be exercised through the 
large muscle groups, particularly the leg muscles. That's why exercises like rapid walking, running, 
biking, swimming, cross-country skiing, and jogging are so beneficial. 

You are considered minimally fit if you can increase your heart rate to at least 100 beats per minute 
and keep it at that level for 30 mi nutes. 

Ideally you should try to raise your heart rate to at least 60 percent of your maximum pulse rate, the 
top speed your heart can beat and still pump blood through your body. Your maximum heart rate is 
generally accepted to be 220 less your age. So, if you are 40, you should aim for an exercise heart rate 
of 108 (220 - 40 = 180 x .6 = 108). The "training effect" is generally considered to be between 72 and 87 
percent of your personal maximum rate. 

Flexibility comes through stretching. Most experts recommend warming up before and cooling 
down/ stretching after aerobic exercise. Before, it helps loosen and warm the muscles to prepare for 
more vigorous exercise. After, it helps to dissipate the lactic acid so that you don'tfeel sore and stiff. 

Strength comes from muscle resistance exercises -- like simple calisthenics, push-ups, and sit-ups, 
and from working with weights. How much emphasis you put on developing strength depends on 
your situation. If you're involved in physical labor or athletic activities, increased strength will 
improve your skill. If you have a basically sedentary job and success in your life-style does not require 
a lot of strength, a littletoning through calisthenics in addition to your aerobic and stretching exercises 
might be sufficient. 

I was in a gym one time with a friend of mine who has a Ph. D. in exercise physiology. He was 
focusing on building strength. He asked me to "spot" him while he did some bench presses and told 
meatacertain point he'd ask me to take the weight. "But don't take it until I tell you," hesaid firmly. 

So I watched and waited and prepared to take the weight. The weight went up and down, up and 
down. And I could see it begin to get harder. But he kept going. He would start to push it up and 
I'd think, 'There's no way he's going to make it." But he'd make it. Then he'd slowly bring it back 
down and start back up again. Up and down, up and down. 

Finally, as I looked at his face, straining with the effort, his blood vessels practically jumping out of 
his skin, I thought, "This is going to fall and collapse his chest. Maybe I should take the weight. 
Maybe he's lost control and he doesn't even know what he's doing." But he'd get it safely down. Then 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyii tyH^Havt 


he'd start back up again. I couldn't believe it" 

"Almost all the benefit of the exercise comes at the very end, Stephen," he replied. "I'm trying to 
build strength. And that doesn't happen until the muscle fiber ruptures and the nerve fiber registers 
the pain. Then nature overcompensates and within 48 hours, thefiber is made stronger." 

I could see his point. It's the same principle that works with emotional muscles as well, such as 
patience. When you exercise your patience beyond your past limits, the emotional fiber is broken, 
nature overcompensates, and next ti me the fi ber is stronger. 

Now my friend wanted to build muscular strength. And he knew how to do it. But not all of us 
need to develop that kind of strength to be effective. "No pain, no gain" has validity in some 
ci rcumstances, but it is not the essence of an effective exercise program. 

The essence of renewing the physical dimension is to sharpen the saw, to exercise our bodies on a 
regular basis in a way that will preserve and enhance our capacity to work and adapt and enjoy. 

And we need to be wise in developing an exercise program. There's a tendency, especially if you 
haven't been exercising at all, to overdo. And that can create unnecessary pain, injury, and even 
permanent damage. It's best to start slowly. Any exercise program should be in harmony with the 
latest research findings, with your doctor's recommendations and with your own self-awareness. 

If you haven't been exercising, your body will undoubtedly protest this change in its comfortable 
downhill direction. You won't like it at first. You may even hate it. But be proactive. Do it 
anyway. Even if it's raining on the morning you've scheduled to jog, do it anyway. "Oh good! It's 
raining! I get to develop my willpower as well as my body!" 

You're not dealing with quick fix; you're dealing with a Quadrant II activity that will bring 
phenomenal long-term results. Ask anyone who has done it consistently. Little by little, your resting 
pulse rate will go down as your heart and oxygen processing system becomes more efficient. As you 
increase your body's ability to do more demanding things, you'll find your normal activities much more 
comfortable and pleasant. You'll have more afternoon energy, and the fatigue you've felt that's made 
you "too tired" to exercise in the past will be replaced by an energy that will invigorate everything you 
do. 

Probably the greatest benefit you will experience from exercising will be the development of your 
Habit 1 muscles of proactivity. As you act based on the value of physical well-being instead of 
reacting to all the forces that keep you from exercising, your paradigm of yourself, your self-esteem, 
your self-confidence, and your integrity will be profoundly affected. 

The Spiritual Dimension 

Renewing the spiritual dimension provides leadership to your life. It's highly related to Habit 2. 

The spiritual dimension is your core, your center, your commitment to your value system. It's a 
very private area of life and a supremely important one. It draws upon the sources that inspire and 
uplift you and tie you to the timeless truths of all humanity. And people do it very, very differently. 

I find renewal in daily prayerful meditation on the scriptures because they represent my value 
system. As I read and meditate, I feel renewed, strengthened, centered, and recommitted to serve. 

Immersion in great literature or great music can provide a similar renewal of the spirit for some. 
There are others who find it in the way they communicate with nature. Nature bequeaths its own 
blessing on those who immerse themselves in it. When you're ableto leave the noise and thediscord 
of the city and give yourself up to the harmony and rhythm of nature, you come back renewed. For a 
time, you're undisturbable, almost unflappable, until gradually the noise and the discord from outside 
start to invade that sense of i nner peace. 

Arthur Gordon shares a wonderful, intimate story of his own spiritual renewal in a little story called 
'TheTurn of the Tide." It tells of a time in his life when he began to feel that everything was stale and 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

flat. His enthusiasm waned; his writing efforts were fruitless. And the situation was growing worse 
day by day. 

Finally, he determined to get help from a medical doctor. Observing nothing physically wrong, the 
doctor asked him if he would be able to follow his instructions for one day. 

When Gordon replied that he could, the doctor told him to spend the following day in the place 
where he was happiest as a child. He could take food, but he was not to talk to anyone or to read or 
write or listen to the radio. He then wrote out four prescriptions and told him to open one at nine, 
twelve, three, and six o'clock. 

"A re you serious?" Gordon asked him. 

"You won't think I'm joking when you get my bill!" was the reply. 

So the next morning, Gordon went to the beach. As he opened the first prescription, he read 
"Listen carefully." He thought the doctor was insane. How could he listen for three hours? But he had 
agreed to follow the doctor's orders, so he listened. He heard the usual sounds of the sea and the birds. 
Afterawhile, hecould hear the other sounds that weren't so apparent at first. As helistened, hebegan 
to think of lessons the sea had taught him as a child -- patience, respect, an awareness of the 
interdependence of things. He began to listen to the sounds-- and the silence-- and to feel a growing 
peace. 

At noon, he opened the second slip of paper and read "Try reaching back." "Reaching back to what?" 
hewondered. Perhaps to childhood, perhaps to memories of happy times. Hethought about his past, 
about the many little moments of joy. He tried to remember them with exactness. And in 
remembering, he found agrowing warmth inside. 

At three o'clock, he opened the third piece of paper. Until now, the prescriptions had been easy to 
take. But this one was different; it said "Examine your motives." At first he was defensive. He 
thought about what he wanted -- success, recognition, security, and he justified them all. But then the 
thought occurred to him that those motives weren't good enough, and that perhaps therein was the 
answer to his stagnant situation. 

He considered his motives deeply. He thought about past happiness. And at last, the answer 
came to him. 

"In a flash of certainty," he wrote, "I saw that if one's motives are wrong, nothing can be right. It 
makes no difference whether you are a mailman, a hairdresser, an insurance salesman, a housewife -- 
whatever. As long as you feel you are serving others, you do the job well. When you are concerned 
only with helping yourself, you do it less well -- a law as inexorable as gravity." 

When six o'clock came, the final prescription didn't take long to fill. "Write your worries on the 
sand," it said. He knelt and wrote several words with a piece of broken shell; then he turned and 
walked away. He didn't look back; he knew the tide would come in. 

Spiritual renewal takes an investment of time. But it's a Quadrant II activity we don't really have 
ti me to neglect. 

The great reformer Martin Luther is quoted assaying, "I have so much to do today, I'll need to spend 
another hour on my knees." To him, prayer was not a mechanical duty but rather a source of power in 
releasing and multiplying his energies. 

Someone once inquired of a Far Eastern Zen master, who had a great serenity and peace about him 
no matter what pressures hefaced, "How do you maintain that serenity and peace?" He replied, "I never 
leave my place of meditation." He meditated early in the morning and for the rest of the day, he carried 
the peace of those moments with him in his mind and heart. 

The idea is that when we take time to draw on the leadership center of our lives, what life is 
ultimately all about, it spreads like an umbrella over everything else. It renews us, it refreshes us, 
particularly if we recommit to it. 

This is why I believe a personal mission statement is so important. If we have a deep 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


ESroutft toyu tyH^Havt 


understanding of our center and our purpose, we can review and recommit to it frequently. In our 
daily spiritual renewal, we can visualize and "live out" the events of the day in harmony with those 
values. 

Religious leader David 0. McKay taught, "The greatest battles of life are fought out daily in the 
silent chambers of the soul." If you win the battles there, if you settle the issues that inwardly conflict, 
you feel a sense of peace, a sense of knowing what you're about. And you'll find that the Public 
Victories -- where you tend to think cooperatively, to promote the welfare and good of other people, 
and to be genuinely happy for other people's successes-- will follow naturally. 

The Mental Dimension 

Most of our mental development and study discipline comes through formal education. But as 
soon as we leave the external discipline of school, many of us let our minds atrophy. We don't do any 
more serious reading, we don't explore new subjects in any real depth outside our action fields, we 
don't think analytically, we don't write -- at least not critically or in a way that tests our ability to 
express ourselves in distilled, clear, and concise language. Instead, wespend ourtimewatchingTV. 

Continuing surveys indicate that television is on in most homes some 35 to 45 hours a week. That's 
as much time as many people put into their jobs, more than most put into school. It's the most 
powerful socializing influence there is. And when we watch, we're subject to all the values that are 
being taught through it. That can powerfully influence us in very subtle and imperceptible ways. 

Wisdom in watching television requires the effective self-management of Habit 3, which enables you 
to discriminate and to select the informing, inspiring, and entertaining programs which best serve and 
express your purpose and values. 

In our family, we limit television watching to around seven hours a week, an average of about an 
hour a day. We had a family council at which we talked about it and looked at some of the data 
regarding what's happening in homes because of television. Wefound that by discussing itasafamily 
when no one was defensive or argumentative, people started to realize the dependent sickness of 
becoming addicted to soap operas or to a steady diet of a particular program. 

I'm grateful for television and for the many high-quality educational and entertainment programs. 
They can enrich our lives and contribute meaningfully to our purposes and goals. But there are many 
programs that simply waste our time and minds and many that influence us in negative ways if we let 
them. Like the body, television is a good servant but a poor master. We need to practice Habit 3 and 
manage ourselves effectively to maximizetheuseof any resourcein accomplishing our missions. 

Education -- continuing education, continually honing and expanding the mind -- is vital mental 
renewal. Sometimes that involves the external discipline of the classroom or systematized study 
programs; more often it does not. Proactive people can figure out many, many ways to educate 
themselves. 

It is extremely valuable to train the mind to stand apart and examine its own program. That, to me, 
is the definition of a liberal education -- the ability to examine the programs of life against larger 
questions and purposes and other paradigms. Training, without such education, narrows and closes 
the mind so that the assumptions underlying the training are never examined. That's why it is so 
valuableto read broadly and to expose yourself to great minds. 

There's no better way to inform and expand your mind on a regular basis than to get into the habit 
of reading good literature. That's another high-leverage Quadrant II activity. You can get into the 
best minds that are now or that have ever been in the world. I highly recommend starting with a goal 
of a book a month then a book every two weeks, then a book a week. "The person who doesn't read is 
no better off than the person who can't read." 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


Quality literature, such as the Great Books, the Harvard Classics, autobiographies, National 
Geographic and other publications that expand our cultural awareness, and current literature in various 
fields can expand our paradigms and sharpen our mental saw, particularly if we practice Habit 5 as we 
read and seek first to understand. If we use our own autobiography to make early judgments before 
we really understand what an author has to say, we limit the benefits of the reading experience. 

Writing is another powerful way to sharpen the mental saw. Keeping a journal of our thoughts, 
experiences, insights, and learnings promotes mental clarity, exactness, and context. Writing good 
letters -- communicating on the deeper level of thoughts, feelings, and ideas rather than on the shallow, 
superficial level of events -- also affects our ability to think clearly, to reason accurately, and to be 
understood effectively. 

Organizing and planning represent other forms of mental renewal associated with Habits 2 and 3. 
It's beginning with the end in mind and being able mentally to organize to accomplish that end. It's 
exercising the visualizing, imagining power of your mind to see the end from the beginning and to see 
the entire journey, at least in principles, if not in steps. 

It is said that wars are won i n the general's tent. Sharpening the saw in the first three dimensions-- 
the physical, the spiritual, and the mental -- is a practice I call the "Daily Private Victory." And I 
commend to you the simple practice of spending one hour a day every day doing it -- one hour a day 
for the rest of your I ife. 

There's no other way you could spend an hour that would begin to compare with the Daily Private 
Victory in terms of value and results. It will affect every decision, every relationship. It will greatly 
improve the quality, the effectiveness, of every other hour of the day, including the depth and 
restfulness of your sleep. It will build the long-term physical, spiritual, and mental strength to enable 
you to handle difficult challenges in life. 

In the words of Phillips Brooks: 

Someday, in the years to come, you will bewrestling with the great temptation, or trembling under 
the great sorrow of your life. But the real struggle is here, now. Now it is being decided whether, in 
the day of your supreme sorrow or temptation, you shall miserably fail or gloriously conquer. 
Character cannot be madeexcept by a steady, long continued process. 

The Social/Emotional Dimension 

While the physical, spiritual, and mental dimensions are closely related to Habits 1, 2, and 3 -- 
centered on the principles of personal vision, leadership, and management -- the social/emotional 
dimension focuses on Habits 4, 5, and 6 -- centered on the principles of interpersonal leadership, 
empathic communication, and creative cooperation. 

The social and the emotional dimensions of our lives are tied together because our emotional life is 
primarily, but not exclusively, developed out of and manifested in our relationships with others. 

Renewing our social/ emotional dimension does not take time in the same sense that renewing the 
other dimensions does. We can do it in our normal everyday interactions with other people. But it 
definitely requires exercise. We may have to push ourselves because many of us have not achieved the 
level of Private Vi dory and the ski 11 s of Public Victory necessary for Habits 4, 5, and 6to come naturally 
to us in all our interactions. 

Suppose that you are a key person in my life. You might be my boss, my subordinate, my 
co-worker, my friend, my neighbor, my spouse, my child, a member of my extended family -- anyone 
with whom I want or need to interact. Suppose we need to communicate together, to work together, 
to discuss a jugular issue, to accomplish a purpose or solve a problem. But we see things differently; 
we're looking through different glasses. You see the young lady, and I seethe old woman. 



THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


So I practice Habit 4. I come to you and I say, "I can see that we're approaching this situation 
differently. Why don't we agree to communicate until wecanfind a solution we both feel good about. 
Would you be willing to do that?" Most people would be willing to say "yes" to that. 

Then I move to Habit 5. "Let me listen to you first." Instead of listening with intent to reply, I listen 
empathically in order to deeply, thoroughly understand your paradigm. When I can explain your 
point of view as well as you can, then I focus on communicating my point of view to you so that you 
can understand it as well. 

Based on the commitment to search for a solution that we both feel good about and a deep 
understanding of each other's points of view, we move to Habit 6. We work together to produce Third 
Alternative solutions to our differences that we both recognize are better than the ones either you or I 
proposed initially. 

Success in Habits 4, 5, and 6 is not primarily a matter of intellect; it's primarily a matter of emotion. 
It's highly related to our sense of personal security. 

If our personal security comes from sources within ourselves, then we have the strength to practice 
the habits of Public Victory. If we are emotionally insecure, even though we may be intellectually very 
advanced, practicing Habits 4, 5, and 6with peoplewho think differently on jugular issues of life can be 
terri bly threatening. 

Where does intrinsic security come from? It doesn't come from the scripts they've handed us. It 
doesn't come from our ci rcumstances or our position. 

It comes from within. It comes from accurate paradigms and correct principles deep in our own 
mind and heart. It comes from Inside-Out congruence, from living a life of integrity in which our daily 
habits reflect our deepest values. 

I believe that a life of integrity is the most fundamental source of personal worth. I do not agree 
with the popular success literature that says that self-esteem is primarily a matter of mindset, of attitude 
-- that you can psyche yourself into peace of mind. 

Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other 
way. 

There is also the intrinsic security that comes as a result of effective interdependent living. There is 
security in knowing that win-win solutions do exist, that life is not always "either/ or," that there are 
almost always mutually beneficial Third Alternatives. There is security in knowing that you can step 
out of your own frame of reference without giving it up, that you can really, deeply understand another 
human being. There is security that comes when you authentically, creatively, and cooperatively 
interact with other people and really experience these interdependent habits. 

There is intrinsic security that comes from service, from helping other people in a meaningful way. 
One important source is your work, when you see yourself in a contributiveand creative mode, really 
making a difference. Another source is anonymous service -- no one knows it and no one necessarily 
ever will. And that's not the concern; the concern is blessing the lives of other people. Influence, not 
recognition, becomes the motive. 

Viktor Frankl focused on the need for meaning and purpose in our lives, something that transcends 
our own lives and taps the best energies within us. The late Dr. Hans Selye, in his monumental 
research on stress, basically says that a long, healthy, and happy life is the result of making 
contributions, of having meaningful projects that are personally exciting and contribute to and bless the 
lives of others. H is ethic was "earn thy neighbor's love. 

This is the true joy in life-- that being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. 
That being a force of nature, instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances 
complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my 
life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 

I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It's a sort of splendid torch which I've got to hold up for 
the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future 
generations. 

N. Eldon Tanner has said, "Service is the rent we pay for the privilege of living on this earth." And 
there are so many ways to serve. Whether or not we belong to a church or service organization or 
have a job that provides meaningful service opportunities, not a day goes by that we can't at least serve 
one other human being by making deposits of unconditional love. 

Scripting Others 

Most people are a function of the social mirror, scripted by the opinions, the perceptions, the 
paradigms of the people around them. As interdependent people, you and I come from a paradigm 
which includes the realization that we are a part of that social mirror. 

We can choose to reflect back to others a clear, undistorted vision of themselves. We can affirm 
their proactive nature and treat them as responsible people. We can help script them as 
principle-centered, value-based, independent, worthwhile individuals. And, with the Abundance 
Mentality, we realize that giving a positive reflection to others in no way diminishes us. It increases us 
because it increases the opportunities for effective interaction with other proactive people. 

At some time in your life, you probably had someone believe in you when you didn't believe in 
yourself. He or she scripted you. Did that make a difference in your life. 

What if you were a positive scripter, an affirmer, of other people? When they're being directed by 
the social mirror to take the lower path, you inspire them toward a higher path because you believe in 
them. You listen to them and empathize with them. You don't absolve them of responsibility; you 
encourage them to be proactive. 

Perhaps you are familiar with the musical, Man of La Mancha. It's a beautiful story about a 
medieval knight who meets a woman of the street, a prostitute. She's being validated in her life-style 
by all of the people in her life. 

But this poet knight sees something else in her, something beautiful and lovely. He also sees her 
virtue, and he affirms it, over and over again. He gives her a new name -- Dulcinea -- a new name 
associated with a new paradigm. 

At first, she utterly denies it; her old scripts are overpowering. She writes him off as a wild-eyed 
fantasizer. But he is persistent. He makes continual deposits of unconditional love and gradually it 
penetrates her scripting. It goes down into her true nature, her potential, and she starts to respond. 
Little by little, she begins to change her life-style. She believes it and she acts from her new paradigm, 
to the initial dismay of everyone else in her life. 

Later, when she begins to revert to her old paradigm, he calls her to his deathbed and sings that 
beautiful song, 'The Impossible Dream," looks her in the eyes, and whispers, "Never forget, you're 
Dulcinea." 

One of the classic stories in the field of self-fulfilling prophecies is of a computer in England that was 
accidentally programmed incorrectly. In academic terms, it labeled a class of "bright" kids "dumb" and 
a class of supposedly "dumb" kids "bright." And that computer report was the primary criterion that 
created the teachers' paradigms about their students at the beginning of the year. 

When the administration finally discovered the mistake five-and-a-half months later, they decided 
to test the kids again without tel ling anyonewhat had happened. And the results were amazing. The 
"bright" kids had gone down significantly in IQ test points. They had been seen and treated as 
mentally limited, uncooperative, and difficult to teach. The teachers' paradigms had become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyR^Hairt 


But the scores in the supposedly "dumb" group had gone up. The teachers had treated them as 
though they were bright, and their energy, their hope, their optimism, their excitement had reflected 
high individual expectations and worth for those kids. 

These teachers were asked what it was like during the first few weeks of the term. "For some 
reason, our methods weren't working," they replied. "So we had to change our methods." The 
information showed that the kids were bright. If things weren't working well, they figured it had to be 
the teaching methods. So they worked on methods. They were proactive; they worked in their Circle 
of Influence. Apparent learner disability was nothing moreor less than teacher inflexibility. 

What do we reflect to others about themselves? And how much does that reflection influence their 
lives? We have so much we can invest in the Emotional Bank Accounts of other people. The more we 
can see people in terms of their unseen potential, the more we can use our imagination rather than our 
memory, with our spouse, our children, our co-workers or employees. We can refuse to label them -- 
we can "see" them in new fresh ways each time we're with them. We can help them become 
independent, fulfilled people capable of deeply satisfying, enriching, and productive relationships with 
others. 

Goethe taught, "Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should 
be and he will become as he can and should be." 

Balance in Renewal 

The self-renewal process must include balanced renewal in all four dimensions of our nature: the 
physical, thespiritual, the mental, and thesocial/ emotional. 

Although renewal in each dimension is important, it only becomes optimally effective as we deal 
with all four dimensions in a wise and balanced way. To neglect any one area negatively impacts the 
rest. 

I have found this to be true in organizations as well as in individual lives. In an organization, the 
physical dimension is expressed in economic terms. The mental or psychological dimension deals 
with the recognition, development, and use of talent. The social/ emotional dimension has to do with 
human relations, with finding meaning through purpose or contribution and through organizational 
integrity. 

When an organization neglects any one or more of these areas, it negatively impacts the entire 
organization. The creative energies that could result in tremendous, positive synergy are instead used 
to fight against the organization and become restraining forces to growth and productivity. 

I have found organizations whose only thrust is economic -- to make money. They usually don't 
publicize that purpose. They someti mes even publicize something else. But in their hearts, their only 
desi re i s to make money. 

Whenever I find this, I also find a great deal of negative synergy in the culture, generating such 
things as interdepartmental rivalries, defensive and protective communication, politicking, and 
masterminding. We can't effectively thrive without making money, but that's not sufficient reason for 
organizational existence. Wecan't live without eating, but we don't live to eat. 

At the other end of the spectrum, I've seen organizations that focused almost exclusively on the 
social/ emotional dimension. They are, in a sense, some kind of social experiment and they have no 
economic criteria to their value system. They have no measure or gauge of their effectiveness, and as a 
result, they lose all kinds of efficiencies and eventually their viability in the marketplace. 

I have found many organizations that develop as many as three of the dimensions - they may have 
good service criteria, good economic criteria, and good human-relations criteria, but they are not really 
committed to identifying, developing, utilizing, and recognizing the talent of people. And if these 
psychological forces are missing, the style will be a benevolent autocracy and the resulting culture will 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyR^Hairt 


reflect different forms of collective resistance, adversarial ism, excessive turnover, and other deep, 
chronic, cultural problems. 

Organizational as well as individual effectiveness requires development and renewal of all four 
dimensions in a wise and balanced way. Any dimension that is neglected will create negative force 
field resistance that pushes against effectiveness and growth. Organizations and individuals that give 
recognition to each of these four dimensions in their mission statement provide a powerful framework 
for balanced renewal. 

This process of continuous improvement is the hall mark of theTotal Quality movement and a key to 
Japan's economic ascendancy. 

Synergy in Renewal 

Balanced renewal is optimally synergetic. The things you do to sharpen the saw in any one 
dimension have positive impact in other dimensions because they are so highly interrelated. Your 
physical health affects your mental health; your spiritual strength affects your social/emotional 
strength. Asyou improve in one dimension, you increaseyour ability in other dimensions as well. 

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People create optimum synergy among these dimensions. 
Renewal in any dimension increases your ability to live at I east one of the Seven Habits. And although 
the habits are sequential, improvement in one habit synergetically increases your ability to live the rest. 

The more proactive you are (Habit 1), the more effectively you can exercise personal leadership 
(Habit 2) and management (Habit 3) in your life. The more effectively you manage your life (Habit 3), 
the more Quadrant II renewing activities you can do (Habit 7). The more you seek first to understand 
(Habit 5), the more effectively you can go for synergetic win-win solutions (Habits 4 and 6). The more 
you improve in any of the habits that lead to independence (Habits 1, 2, and 3), the more effective you 
will be in interdependent situations (Habits 4, 5, and 6). And renewal (Habit 7) is the process of 
renewing all the habits. 

Asyou renew your physical dimension, you reinforce your personal vision (Habit 1), the paradigm 
of your own self-awareness and freewill, of proactivity, of knowing that you are free to act instead of 
being acted upon, to choose your own response to any stimulus. This is probably the greatest benefit 
of physical exercise. Each Daily Private Victory makes a deposit in your personal intrinsic security 
account. 

As you renew your spiritual dimension, you reinforce your personal leadership (Habit 2). You 
increase your ability to live out of your imagination and conscience instead of only your memory, to 
deeply understand your innermost paradigms and values, to create within yourself a center of correct 
principles, to define your own unique mission in life, to rescript yourself to live your life in harmony 
with correct principles and to draw upon your personal sources of strength. The rich private life you 
create in spiritual renewal makes tremendous deposits in your personal security account. 

As you renew your mental dimension, you reinforce your personal management (Habit 3). As you 
plan, you force your mind to recognize high-leverage Quadrant II activities, priority goals, and 
activities to maximize the use of your time and energy, and you organize and execute your activities 
around your priorities. As you become involved in continuing education, you increase your 
knowledge base and you increaseyour options. Your economic security does not lie in your job; it lies 
in your own power to produce -- to think, to learn, to create, to adapt. That's true financial 
independence. It's not having wealth; it's having the power to produce wealth. It's intrinsic. 

The Daily Private Victory -- a minimum of one hour a day in renewal of the physical, spiritual, and 
mental dimensions -- is the key to the development of the Seven Habits and it's completely within your 
Circleof Influence. It istheQuadrant II focus time necessary to integrate these habits into your life, to 
become pri nci pie-centered. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


It's also the foundation for the Daily Public Victory. It's the source of intrinsic security you need to 
sharpen the saw in the social/emotional dimension. It gives you the personal strength to focus on 
your Circle of Influence in interdependent situations -- to look at others through the Abundance 
Mentality paradigm, to genuinely value their differences and to be happy for their success. It gives 
you the foundation to work for genuine understanding and for synergetic win-win solutions, to practice 
Habits4, 5, and 6in an interdependent reality. 

The Upward Spiral 

Renewal is the principle -- and the process -- that empowers us to move on an upward spiral of 
growth and change, of continuous improvement. 

To make meaningful and consistent progress along that spiral, we need to consider one other aspect 
of renewal as it applies to the unique human endowment that directs this upward movement -- our 
conscience. In the words of M adame de Sta'I, 'The voice of conscience is so delicate that it is easy to 
stifle it: but it is also so clear that it is impossible to mistake it." 

Conscience is the endowment that senses our congruence or disparity with correct principles and 
lifts us toward them - when it's in shape 

Just as the education of nerve and sinew is vital to the excellent athlete and education of the mind is 
vital to the scholar, education of the conscience is vital to the truly proactive, highly effective person. 
Training and educating the conscience, however, requires even greater concentration, more balanced 
discipline, more consistently honest living. It requires regular feasting on inspiring literature, thinking 
noble thoughts and, aboveall, living in harmony with its still small voice 

Just as junk food and lack of exercise can ruin an athlete's condition, those things that are obscene, 
crude, or pornographic can breed an inner darkness that numbs our higher sensibilities and substitutes 
the social conscience of "Will I be found out?" for the natural or divine conscience of "What is right and 
wrong?" 

In the words of Dag Hammarskjold, 

You cannot play with the animal in you without becoming wholly animal, play with falsehood 
without forfeiting your right to truth, play with cruelty without losing your sensitivity of mind. He 
who wants to keep his garden tidy doesn't reserve a plot for weeds. 

Once we are self-aware, we must choose purposes and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum 
will be filled,and wewill lose our self-awareness and become I ike groveling animals who live primarily 
for survival and propagation. People who exist on that level aren't living; they are "being lived." They 
are reacting, unaware of theunique endowments that liedormant and undeveloped within. 

And there is no shortcut in developing them. The Law of the Harvest governs; wewill always reap 
what we sow -- no more, no less. The law of justice is immutable, and the closer we align ourselves 
with correct principles, the better our judgment will be about how the world operates and the more 
accurate our paradigms -- our maps of the territory --will be. 

I believe that as wegrow and develop on this upward spiral, we must show diligence in the process 
of renewal by educating and obeying our conscience. An increasingly educated conscience will propel 
us along the path of personal freedom, security, wisdom, and power. 

Moving along the upward spiral requires us to learn, commit, and do on increasingly higher planes. 
We deceive ourselves if we think that any one of these is sufficient. To keep progressing, we must 
learn, commit, and do -- learn, commit, and do -- and learn, commit, and do again. 


Application Suggestions: 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Hairt 


1. Make a list of activities that would help you keep in good physical shape, that would fit your 
life-style and that you could enjoy overtime. 

2. Select one of the activities and list it as a goal in your personal role area for the coming week. 
At the end of the week evaluate your performance. If you didn't make your goal, was it because you 
subordinated itto a genuinely higher value? Or did you fail to act with integrity to your values. 

3. Make a similar list of renewing activities in your spiritual and mental dimensions. In your 
social-emotional area, list relationships you would like to improve or specific circumstances in which 
Public Victory would bring greater effectiveness. Select one item in each area to list as a goal for the 
week. Implement and evaluate. 

4. Committo writedown specific "sharpen the saw" activities in all four dimensions every week, to 
do them, and to evaluate your performance and results. 


Inside-Out Again 


TheLord works from the inside out. Theworld works from the outside in. Theworld would take 
peopleout of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the 
slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then 
change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human 
nature. 

- Ezra Taft Benson 


* * 

I would like to share with you a personal story which I feel contains the essence of this book. In 
doing so, it is my hope that you will relate to the underlying principles it contains. 

Some years ago, our family took a sabbatical leave from the university where I taught so that I could 
write. We lived for a full year in Laieon the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. 

Shortly after getting settled, we developed a living and working routine which was not only very 
productive but extremely pleasant. 

After an early morning run on the beach, we would send two of our children, barefoot and in shorts, 
to school. I went to an isolated building next to the cane fields where I had an office to do my writing. 
It was very quiet, very beautiful, very serene- no phone, no meetings, no pressing engagements. 

My office was on the outside edge of the college, and one day as I was wandering between stacks of 
books i n the back of the col I ege I i brary, I came across a book that d rew my i nterest. A s I opened it, my 
eyes fell upon a single paragraph that powerfully influenced the rest of my life. 

I read the paragraph over and over again. It basically contained the simple idea that there is a gap 
or a space between stimulus and response, and that the key to both our growth and happiness is how 
we use that space. 

I can hardly describe the effect that idea had on my mind. Though I had been nurtured in the 
philosophy of self-determinism, the way the idea was phrased - "a gap between stimulus and response" 
- hit me with fresh, almost unbelievable force. It was almost like "knowing it for the first time," I ike an 
inward revolution, "an idea whose time had come." 

I reflected on it again and again, and it began to have a powerful effect on my paradigm of life. It 
was as if I had become an observer of my own participation. I began to stand in that gap and to look 
outside at the stimuli. I reveled in the inward sense of freedom to choose my response - even to 
become the stimulus, or at least to influence it - even to reverse it. 

Shortly thereafter, and partly as a result of this "revolutionary" idea, Sandra and I began a practice of 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toycu tyH^Havt 


deep communication. I would pick her up a little before noon on an old red Honda 90 trail cycle, and 
we would take our two preschool children with us-- one between us and the other on my left knee-- as 
we rode out in the canefields by my office. We rode slowly along for about an hour, just talking. 

The children looked forward to the ride and hardly ever made any noise. We seldom saw another 
vehicle, and the cycle was so quiet we could easily hear each other. We usually ended up on an 
isolated beach where we parked the Honda and walked about 200 yards to a secluded spot where we 
atea picnic lunch. 

The sandy beach and a freshwater river coming off the island totally absorbed the interest of the 
children, so Sandra and I were able to continue our talks uninterrupted. Perhaps it doesn't take too 
much imagination to envision the level of understanding and trust we were able to reach by spending 
at least two hours a day, every day, for a full year in deep communication. 

At the very first of the year, we talked about all kinds of interesting topics -- people, ideas, events, 
the children, my writing, our family at home, future plans, and so forth. But little by little, our 
communication deepened and we began to talk more and more about our internal worlds -- about our 
upbringing, our scripting, our feelings, and self-doubts. As we were deeply immersed in these 
communications, we also observed them and observed ourselves in them. We began to use that space 
between stimulus and response in some new and interesting ways which caused us to think about how 
we were programmed and how those programs shaped how wesaw the world. 

We began an exciting adventure into our interior worlds and found it to be more exciting, more 
fascinating, more absorbing, more compelling, more filled with discovery and insight than anything 
we'd even known in the outside world. 

It wasn't all "sweetness and light." We occasionally hit some raw nerves and had some painful 
experiences, embarrassing experiences, self-revealing experiences -- experiences that made us extremely 
open and vulnerable to each other. And yetwefound wehad been wanting to go into those things for 
years. When we did go into the deeper, more tender issues and then came out of them, wefeltin some 
way healed. 

We were so initially supportive and helpful, so encouraging and empathic to each other, that we 
nurtured and facilitated theseinternal discoveries in each other. 

We gradually evolved two unspoken ground rules. The first was "no probing." As soon as we 
unfolded the inner layers of vulnerability, we were not to question each other, only to empathize. 
Probing was simply too invasive. It was also too controlling and too logical. We were covering new, 
difficult terrain that was scary and uncertain, and it stirred up fears and doubts. We wanted to cover 
more and more of it, but we grew to respect the need to let each other open up in our own time. 

The second ground rule was that when it hurt too much, when it was painful, wewould simply quit 
for the day. Then wewould either begin the next day where we left off or wait until the person who 
was sharing felt ready to continue. We carried around the loose ends, knowing that we wanted to deal 
with them. But because we had the time and the environment conducive to it, and because we were so 
excited to observe our own involvement and to grow within our marriage, we simply knew that sooner 
or later wewould deal with all those loose ends and bring them to some kind of closure. 

The most difficult, and eventually the most fruitful part of this kind of communication came when 
my vulnerability and Sandra's vulnerability touched. Then, because of our subjective involvement, we 
found that the space between stimulus and responsewas no longer there. A few bad feelings surfaced. 
But our deep desire and our implicit agreement was to prepare ourselves to start where we left off and 
deal with those feelings until we resolved them. 

One of those difficult times had to do with a basic tendency in my personality. My father was a 
very private individual -- very controlled and very careful. My mother was and is very public, very 
open, very spontaneous. I find both sets of tendencies in me, and when I feel insecure, I tend to 
become private, like my father. I live inside myself and safely observe. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


Sandra is more like my mother -- social, authentic, and spontaneous. We had gone through many 
experiences over the years in which I felt her openness was inappropriate, and she felt my constraint 
was dysfunctional, both socially and to me as an individual because I would become insensitive to the 
feelings of others. All of this and much more came out during those deep visits. I came to value 
Sandra's insight and wisdom and the way she helped me to be a more open, giving, sensitive, social 
person. 

Another of those difficult times had to do with what I perceived to be a "hang up" Sandra had which 
had bothered me for years. She seemed to have an obsession about Frigidaire appliances which I was 
at an absolute loss to understand. She would not even consider buying another brand of appliance. 
Even when we were just starting out and on a very tight budget, she insisted that we drive the fifty 
miles to the "big city" where Frigidaire appliances were sold, simply because no dealer in our small 
university town carried them at that ti me. 

This was a matter of considerable agitation to me. Fortunately, the situation came up only when 
we purchased an appliance. But when it did come up, it was like a stimulus that triggered off a hot 
button response. This single issue seemed to be symbolic of all irrational thinking, and it generated a 
whole range of negative feelings within me. 

I usually resorted to my dysfunctional private behavior. I suppose I figured that the only way I 
could deal with it was not to deal with it; otherwise, I felt I would lose control and say things I shouldn't 
say. There were times when I did slip and say something negative, and I had to go back and 
apologize. 

What bothered me the most was not that she liked Frigidaire, but that she persisted in making what 
I considered utterly illogical and indefensible statements to defend Frigidaire which had no basis in fact 
whatsoever. If she had only agreed that her response was irrational and purely emotional, I think I 
could have handled it. But her justification was upsetting. 

It was sometime in early spring when the Frigidaire issue came up. All our prior communication 
had prepared us. The ground rules had been deeply established--not to probe and to leave it alone if 
it got to be too painful for either or both. 

I will never forget the day we talked itthrough. Wedidn'tend up on the beach that day; we just 
continued to ride through the canefields, perhaps because we didn't want to look each other in the eye. 
There had been so much psychic history and so many bad feelings associated with the issue, and it had 
been submerged for so long. It had never been so critical as to rupture the relationship, but when 
you're trying to cultivatea beautiful unified relationship, any divisive issue is important. 

Sandra and I were amazed at what we learned through the interaction. It was truly synergistic. It 
was as if Sandra were learning, almost for the first time herself, the reason for her so-called hang-up. 
She started to talk about her father, about how he had worked as a high school history teacher and 
coach for years, and how, to help make ends meet, he had gone into the appliance business. During an 
economic downturn, he had experienced serious financial difficulties, and the only thing that enabled 
him to stay in business during that time was the fact that Frigidaire would finance his inventory. 

Sandra had an unusually deep and sweet relationship with her father. When he returned home at 
the end of a very tiring day, hewould lieon the couch, and Sandra would rub hisfeet and sing to him. 
It was a beautiful time they enjoyed together almost daily for years. He would also open up and talk 
through his worries and concerns about the business, and he shared with Sandra his deep appreciation 
for Frigidaire financing his inventory so that he could makeitthrough the difficult times. 

This communication between father and daughter had taken place in a spontaneous way during 
very natural time, when the most powerful kind of scripting takes place. During those relaxed times 
guards are down and all kinds of images and thoughts are planted deep in the subconscious mind. 
Perhaps Sandra had forgotten about all of this until the safety of that year of communication when it 
could come out also in very natural and spontaneous ways. 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Havt 


Sandra gained tremendous insight into herself and into the emotional root of her feelings about 
Frigidaire. I also gained insight and a whole new level of respect. I came to realize that Sandra 
wasn't talking about appliances; she was talking about her father, and about loyalty -- about loyalty to 
his needs. 

I remember both of us becoming tearful on that day, not so much because of the insights, but 
because of the increased sense of reverence we had for each other. We discovered that even seemingly 
trivial things often have roots in deep emotional experiences. To deal only with the superficial trivia 
without seeing the deeper, more tender issues istotrampleon the sacred ground of another's heart. 

There were many rich fruits of those months. Our communication became so powerful that we 
could almost instantly connect with each other's thoughts. When we left Hawaii, we resolved to 
continue the practice. During the many years since, we have continued to go regularly on our Honda 
trail cycle, or in the car if the weather's bad, just to talk. We feel the key to staying in love is to talk, 
particularly about feelings. We try to communicate with each other several times every day, even 
when I'm traveling. It's like touching in to home base, which accesses all the happiness, security, and 
values it represents. 

Thomas Wolfe was wrong. You can go home again -- if your home is a treasured relationship, a 
precious companionship. 

Intergenerational Living 

As Sandra and I discovered that wonderful year, the ability to use wisely the gap between stimulus 
and response, to exercise the four unique endowments of our human nature, empowered us from the 
Inside-Out. 

We had tried the outside-in approach. We loved each other, and we had attempted to work 
through our differences by controlling our attitudes and our behaviors, by practicing useful techniques 
of human interaction. But our band-aids and aspirin only lasted so long. Until we worked and 
communicated on the level of our essential paradigms, the chronic underlying problems werestill there. 

When we began to work from the Inside-Out, we were able to build a relationship of trust and 
openness and to resolve dysfunctional differences in a deep and lasting way that never could have 
come by working from the outside in. The delicious fruits -- a rich win-win relationship, a deep 
understanding of each other, and a marvelous synergy -- grew out of the roots we nurtured as we 
examined our programs, rescripted ourselves, and managed our lives so that we could create time for 
the important Quadrant II activity of communicating deeply with each other. 

And there were other fruits. We were able to see on a much deeper level that, just as powerfully as 
our own lives had been affected by our parents, the lives of our children were being influenced and 
shaped by us, often in ways we didn't even begin to realize. Understanding the power of scripting in 
our own lives, wefelt a renewed desire to do everything we could to make certain that what we passed 
on to future generations, by both precept and example, was based on correct principles. 

I have drawn particular attention in this book to those scripts we have been given which we 
proactively want to change. But as we examine our scripting carefully, many of us will also begin to 
see beautiful scripts, positive scripts that have been passed down to us which we have blindly taken for 
granted. Real self-awareness helps us to appreciate those scripts and to appreciate those who have 
gone before us and nurtured us in principle-based living, mirroring back to us not only what we are, 
but w hat we can become. 

There is transcendent power in a strong intergenerational family. An effectively interdependent 
family of children, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins can be a powerful force in helping 
people have a sense of who they are and where they came from and what they stand for. 

It's great for children to be able to identify themselves with the "tribe," to feel that many people 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


know them and care about them, even though they're spread all over the country. And that can be a 
tremendous benefit as you nurture your family. If one of your children is having difficulty and doesn't 
really relate with you at a particular time in his life, maybe he can relate to your brother or sister who 
can become a surrogate father or mother, a mentor, or a hero for a period of time. 

Grandparents who show a great interest in their grandchildren are among the most precious people 
on this earth. What a marvelous positive social mirror they can be! My mother is like that. Even 
now, in her late 80s, she takes a deep personal interest in every one of her descendants. She writes us 
love letters. I was reading one the other day on a plane with tears streaming down my cheeks. I 
could call her up tonight and I know she'd say, "Stephen, I want you to know how much I love you 
and how wonderful I think you are." She's constantly reaffirming. 

A strong intergenerational family is potentially one of the most fruitful, rewarding, and satisfying 
interdependent relationships. And many peoplefeel the importance of that relationship. Look at the 
fascination we all had with Roots some years ago. Each of us has roots and the ability to trace those 
roots, to identify our ancestors. 

The highest and most powerful motivation in doing that is not for ourselves only, but for our 
posterity, for the posterity of all mankind. As someone once observed, 'There are only two lasting 
bequests wecan give our children -- oneisroots, the other wings." 

Becoming a Transition Person 

Among other things, I believe that giving "wings" to our children and to others means empowering 
them with the freedom to rise above negative scripting that had been passed down to us. I believe it 
means becoming what my friend and associate, Dr. Terry Warner, calls a "transition" person. Instead 
of transferring those scripts to the next generation, we can change them. And we can do it in a way 
that will build relationships in the process 

If your parents abused you as a child, that does not mean that you have to abuse your own children. 
Yet there's plenty of evidence to indicate that you will tend to live out that script. But because you're 
proactive, you can rewrite the script. You can choose not only not to abuse your children, but to affirm 
them, to scri pt them i n positive ways. 

You can write it in your personal mission statement and into your mind and heart. You can 
visualize yourself living in harmony with that mission statement in your Daily Private Victory. You 
can take steps to love and forgive your own parents, and if they are still living, to build a positive 
relationship with them by seeking to understand. 

A tendency that's run through your family for generations can stop with you. You're a transition 
person -- a link between the past and the future. And your own change can affect many, many lives 
downstream. 

One powerful transition person of the twentieth century, Anwar Sadat, left us as part of his legacy a 
profound understanding of the nature of change. Sadat stood between a past that had created a "huge 
wall of suspicion, fear, hate and misunderstanding" between Arabs and Israelis, and a future in which 
increased conflict and isolation seemed inevitable. Efforts at negotiation had been met with objections 
on every scale -- even to formalities and procedural points, to an insignificant comma or period in the 
text of proposed agreements. 

While others attempted to resolve the tense situation by hacking at the leaves, Sadat drew upon his 
earlier centering experience in a lonely prison cell and went to work on the root. And in doing so, he 
changed the course of history for millions of people. 

He records in his autobiography: 

It was then that I drew, almost unconsciously, on the inner strength I had developed in Cell 54 of 
Cairo Central Prison -- a strength, call it a talent or capacity, for change. I found that I faced a highly 



THE SEVEN HABHS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyii tyH^Hairt. 


complex situation, and that I couldn't hope to change it until I had armed myself with the necessary 
psychological and intellectual capacity. My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded 
place had taught me that he who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to 
change reality, and will never, therefore, makeany progress. 

Change-- real change-- comes from the Inside-Out. It doesn't come from hacking at the leaves of 
attitude and behavior with quick-fix personality ethic techniques. It comes from striking at the root -- 
the fabric of our thought, the fundamental, essential paradigms, which give definition to our character 
and createthe lens through which wesee the world. In the words of A miel: 

Moral truth can be conceived in thought. One can have feelings about it. One can will to live it. 
But moral truth may have been penetrated and possessed in all these ways, and escape us still. Deeper 
even than consciousness there is our being itself -- our very substance, our nature. Only those truths 
which have entered into this last region, which have become ourselves, become spontaneous and 
involuntary as well as voluntary, unconscious as well as conscious, are really our life -- that is to say, 
something more than property. So long as we are able to distinguish any space whatever between 
Truth and us we remai n outsi de it. The thought, the feel i ng, the desi re or the consci ousness of I ife may 
not be quite life. To become divine is then the aim of life. Then only can truth be said to be ours 
beyond the possibility of loss. It is no longer outside us, nor in a sense even in us, but we are it, and it 
is we. 

Achieving unity -- oneness -- with ourselves, with our loved ones, with our friends and working 
associates, is the highest and best and most delicious fruit of the Seven H abits. M ost of us have tasted 
this fruit of true unity from time to time in the past, as we have also tasted the bitter, lonely fruit of 
disunity-- and we know how precious and fragile unity is. 

Obviously building character of total integrity and living the lifeof love and service that creates such 
unity isn't easy. It isn't quick fix. 

But it's possible. It begins with the desire to center our lives on correct principles, to break out of 
the paradigms created by other centers and the comfort zones of unworthy habits. 

Sometimes we make mistakes, wefeel awkward. But if we start with the Daily Private Victory and 
work from the Inside-Out, the results will surely come. As we plant the seed and patiently weed and 
nourish it, we begin to feel the excitement of real growth and eventually taste the incomparably 
delicious fruits of a congruent, effective life. 

Again, I quote Emerson: "That which wepersist in doing becomes easier-- not that the nature of the 
task has changed, but our ability to do has increased." 

By centering our lives on correct principles and creating a balanced focus between doing and 
increasing our ability to do, we become empowered in the task of creating effective, useful, and 
peaceful lives...for ourselves, and for our posterity. 


A Personal Note 

As I conclude this book, I would I ike to share my own personal conviction concerning what I believe 
to be the source of correct principles. I believe that correct principles are natural laws, and that God, 
the Creator and Father of us all, is the source of them, and also the source of our conscience. I believe 
that to the degree people live by this inspired conscience, they will grow to fulfill their natures; to the 
degree thatthey do not, they will not rise above the animal plane. 

I believe that there are parts to human nature that cannot be reached by either legislation or 
education, but require the power of God to deal with. I believe that as human beings, we cannot 
perfect ourselves. To the degree to which we align ourselves with correct principles, divine 
endowments will be released within our nature in enabling us to fulfill the measure of our creation. In 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE 


Brcu^t toyu tyH^Havt 


the words of Teilhard de Chardin, "We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are 
spiritual beings having a human experience." 

I personally struggle with much of what I have shared in this book. But the struggle is worthwhile 
and fulfilling. It gives meaning to my life and enables me to love, to serve, and to try again. 

Again, T. S. Eliot expresses so beautifully my own personal discovery and conviction: "We must 
not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to 
know the pi ace for the first time."

Appendix B 


A Quadrant 11 Day at the Office 

The following exercise and analysis is designed to help you see the impact of a Quadrant II 
paradigm in a business setting on a very practical level. 

Suppose that you are the director of marketing for a major pharmaceutical firm. You are about to 
begin an average day at the office, and as you look over the items to attend to that day, you estimate the 
amou nt of ti me each one w i 11 take. 

Your unprioritized list includesthefollowing: 

1. You'd like to have lunch with the general manager (1-11/ 2 hours). 

2. You were instructed the day before to prepare your media budget for thefollowing year (2 or 3 
days). 

3. Your "IN" basket is overflowing into your "OUT" basket (1-11/ 2 hours). 

4. You need to talk to the sales manager about last month's sales; his office is down the hall (4 
hours). 

5. You have several items of correspondence that your secretary says are urgent (1 hour). 

6. You'd like to catch up on the medical journals piled upon your desk (1/ 2 hour). 

7. You need to prepare a presentation for a sales meeting slated for next month (2 hours). 

8. There's a rumor that the last batch of product X didn't pass quality control. 

9. Someone from the FDA wants you to return hiscall about productX (1/ 2 hour). 

10. There is a meeting at 2 P.M. for the executive board, but you don't know what it is about (1 
hour). 

Take a few minutes now and use what you have learned from Habits 1, 2, and 3 that might help you 
to effectively scheduleyour day. 

By asking you to plan only one day, I have automatically eliminated the wider context of the week 
so fundamental to fourth generation time management. But you will be able to see the power of 
Quadrantll, principle-centered paradigm even in the context of one nine-hour period of time 

It is fairly obvious that most of the items on the list are Quadrant I activities. With the exception of 
item number six -- catching up on medical journals -- everything else is seemingly both important and 



THE SEVEN HABUS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

urgent. 

If you were a third-generation time manager, using prioritized values and goals, you would have a 
framework for making such scheduling decisions and would perhaps assign a letter such as A, B, or C 
next to each item and then number 1, 2, 3 under each A, B, and C. You would also consider the 
circumstances, such as the avail ability of other people involved, and thelogical amount of time required 
to eat lunch. Finally, based on all of these factors, you would schedule the day. 

Many third-generation time managers who have done this exercise do exactly what I have described. 
They schedule when they will do what, and based on various assumptions which are made and 
explicitly identified, they would accomplish or at least begin most of the items in that day and push the 
remainder onto the next day or to some other time. 

For instance, most people indicate that they would use the time between 8 and 9 A.M. to find out 
exactly what was on the agenda for the executive board meeti ng so that they could prepare for it, to set 
up lunch with the general manager around noon, and to return the call from the FDA. They usually 
plan to spend the next hour or two talking to the sales manager, handling those correspondence items 
which are most i mportant and urgent, and checking out the rumor regarding the last batch of product X 
which apparently didn't pass quality control. The rest of that morning is spent in preparing for the 
luncheon visit with the general manager and/ or for the 2 P.M. executive board meeting, or dealing with 
whatever problems were uncovered regarding product X and last month's sales. 

After lunch, the afternoon is usually spent attending to the unfinished matters just mentioned 
and/or attempting to finish the other most important and urgent correspondence, making some 
headway into the overflowing "IN" basket, and handling other important and urgent items that may 
have come up during the course of the day. 

Most people feel the media budget preparations for the following year and the preparation for the 
next month's sales meeting could probably be put off until another day, which may not have as many 
Quadrant I items in it. Both of those are obviously more Quadrant II activities, having to do with 
long-term thinking and planning. The medical journals continue to be set aside because they are 
clearly Quadrant II and are probably less important than the other two Quadrant II matters just 
mentioned. 

What approach did you take as you scheduled those items? Was it similar to the third-generation 
approach? Or did you take a Quadrant II, fourth-generation approach? (refer to the Time Management 
Matrix on page 151). 

The Quadrant 11 Approach 

Let's go through the items on the list using a Quadrant II approach. This is only one possible 
scenario; others could be created, which may also be consistent with the Quadrant II paradigm, but this 
is illustrative of the kind of thinking it embodies. 

As a Quadrant II manager, you would recognize that most P activities are in Quadrant I and most 
PC activities are in Quadrant II. You would know that the only way to make Quadrant I manageable 
is to give considerable attention to Quadrant II, primarily by working on prevention and opportunity 
and by having the courage to say "no" to Quad rants III and IV. 

The 2:00P.M. board meeting. Wewill assume the 2 P.M. executive board meetingdid not have an 
agenda for the attending executives, or perhaps you would not seethe agenda until you arrived at the 
meeting. This is not uncommon. Asa result, people tend to come unprepared and to "shoot from the 
hip." Such meetings are usually disorganized and focus primarily on Quadrant I issues which are both 
important and urgent, and around which there is often a great deal of sharing of ignorance. These 
meetings generally result in wasted time and inferior results and are often little more than an ego trip

for the executive in charge. 

In most meetings, Quadrant II items are usually categorized as "other business." Because "work 
expands to fill the time allotted for its completion" in accordance with Parkinson's Law, there usually 
isn't time to discuss them. If there is, people have been so beaten and smashed by Quadrant I, they 
have little or no energy left to address them. 

So you might move into Quadrant II by first attempting to get yourself on the agenda so that you 
can make a presentation regarding how to optimize the value of executive board meetings. You might 
also spend an hour or two in the morning preparing for that presentation, even if you are only allowed 
a few minutes to sti mu I ate everyone's interest in hearing a more extended preparation at the next board 
meeting. This presentation would focus on the importance of always having a clearly specified 
purpose for each meeting and a well-thought-out agenda to which each person at the meeting has had 
the opportunity to contribute. The final agenda would be developed by the chairman of the executive 
board and would focus first in Quadrant II issues that usually require more creative thinking rather 
than Quadrant I issues that generally involve more mechanical thinking. 

The presentation would also stress the importance of having minutes sent out immediately 
following the meeting, specifying assignments given and dates of accountability. These items would 
then be placed on appropriate future agendas which would be sent out in plenty of time for others to 
prepare to discuss them. 

Now this is what might be done by looking at one item on the schedule -- the 2 P.M. executive 
board meeting -- through a Quadrant II frame of reference. This requires a high level of proactivity, 
including the courage to challenge the assumption that you even need to schedule the items in the first 
place. It also requires consideration in order to avoid the kind of crisis atmosphere that often 
surrounds a board meeting. 

Almost every other item on the list can be approached with the same Quadrant II thinking, with 
perhaps the exception of the FDA call. 

Returning the FDA call. Based on the background of the quality of the relationship with the FDA, 
you make that call in the morning so that whatever it reveals can be dealt with appropriately. This 
might be difficult to delegate, si nee another organization is involved that may have a Quadrant I culture 
and an individual who wants you, and not some delegatee, to respond. 

While you may attempt to directly influence the culture of your own organization as a member of 
the executive board, your Circleof Influence is probably not large enough to really influence theculture 
of the FDA, so you simply comply with the request. If you find the nature of the problem uncovered 
in the phone call is persistent or chronic, then you may approach it from a Quadrant II mentality in an 
effort to prevent such problems in the future. This again would require considerable proactivity to 
seize the opportunity to transform the quality of the relationship with the FDA or to work on the 
problems in a preventive way. 

Lunch with the general manager. You might see having lunch with the general manager as a rare 
opportunity to discuss some longer-range, Quadrant II matters in a fairly informal atmosphere. This 
may also take 30 to 60 minutes in the morning to adequately prepare for, or you may simply decide to 
have a good social interaction and listen carefully, perhaps without any plan at all. Either possibility 
may presentagood opportunity to build your relationship with the general manager. 

Preparing the media budget. Regarding item number two, you might call in two or three of your 
associates most directly connected to media budget preparation and ask them to bring their 
recommendations in the form of "completed staff work" (which may only require your initials to finally 
approve) or perhaps to outline two or three well-thought-out options you can choose from and identify 
the consequences of each option. This may take a full hour sometime during the day -- to go over 
desired results, guidelines, resources, accountability, and consequences. But by investing the one hour, 
you tap the best thinking of concerned people who may have different points of view. If you haven't

taken this approach before, you may need to spend more time to train them in what this approach 
involves, what "completed staff work" means, how to synergize around differences and what 
identifying alternative options and consequences involves. 

The "In" basket and correspondence. Instead of diving into the "IN" basket, you would spend some 
time, perhaps 30 to 60 minutes, beginning a training process with your secretary so that he or she could 
gradually become empowered to handle the "IN" basket as well as the correspondence under item 
number five. This training program might go on for several weeks, even months, until your secretary 
or assistant is really capable of being results-minded rather than methods-minded. 

Your secretary could be trained to go through all correspondence items and all "IN" basket items, to 
analyze them and to handle as many as possible. Items that could not be handled with confidence 
could be carefully organized, prioritized, and brought to you with a recommendation or a note for your 
own action. In this way, within afew months your secretary or executive assistant could hand 80 to 90 
percent of all the "IN" basket items and correspondence, often much better than you could handlethem 
yourself, simply because your mind is so focused on Quadrant II opportunities instead of buried in 
Quadrant I problems. 

The sales manager and last month's sales. A possible Quadrant II approach to item number four 
would be to think through the entire relationship and performance agreement with that sales manager 
to see if the Quadrant II approach is being used. The exercise doesn't indicate what you need to talk to 
the sales manager about, but assuming it's a Quadrant I item, you could take the Quadrant II approach 
and work on the chronic nature of the problem as well as the Quadrant I approach to solve the 
immediate need. 

Possibly you could train your secretary to handlethe matter without your involvement and bring to 
your attention only that which you need to be aware of. This may involve some Quadrant II activity 
with your sales manager and others reporting to you so they understand that your primary function is 
leadership rather than management. They can begin to understand that they can actually solve the 
problem better with your secretary than with you, and free you for Quadrant II leadership activity. 

If you feel that the sales manager might be offended by having your secretary make the contact, then 
you could begin the process of building that relationship so that you can eventually win the confidence 
of the sales manager toward your both taking a more beneficial Quadrant II approach. 

Catching up on medical journals. Reading medical journals is a Quadrant II item you may want to 
procrastinate. But your own long-term professional competence and confidence may largely be a 
function of staying abreast of this literature. So, you may decide to put the subject on the agenda for 
your own staff meeting, where you could suggest that a systematic approach to reading the medical 
journals be set up among your staff. M embers of the staff could study different journals and teach the 
rest the essence of what they learn at future staff meetings. In addition, they could supply others with 
key articles or excerpts which everyone really needs to read and understand. 

Preparing for next month's sales meeting. Regarding item number seven, a possible Quadrant II 
approach might be to call together a small group of the people who report to you and charge them to 
make a thorough analysis of the needs of the salespeople. You could assign them to bring a completed 
staff work recommendation to you be a specified date within a week or 10 days, giving you enough 
time to adapt it and have it implemented. This may involve their interviewing each of the salespeople 
to discover their real concerns and needs, or it might involve sampling the sales group so that the sales 
meeting agenda is relevant and is sent out in plenty of time so that the salespeople can prepare and 
get involved in it in appropriate ways. 

Rather than prepare the sales meeting yourself, you could delegate that task to a small group of 
people who represent different points of view and different kinds of sales problems. Let them interact 
constructively and creatively and bring to you a finished recommendation. If they are not used to this 
kind of assignment, you may spend some of that meeting challenging and training them, teaching them

Brajcjt to you tyHyHsut 


why you are using this approach and how it will benefit them as well. In doing so, you are beginning 
to train your people to think long-term, to be responsible for completing staff work or other desired 
results, to creatively interact with each other in interdependent ways, and to do a quality job within 
specified deadlines. 

Product "X" and quality control. Now let's look at item number eight regarding product "X," which 
didn't pass quality control. TheQuadrant II approach would beto study that problem to see if it has a 
chronic or persistent dimension to it. If so, you could delegate to others the careful analysis of that 
chronic problem with instructions to bring to you a recommendation, or perhaps simply to implement 
what they come up with and inform you of the results. 

The net effect of this Quadrant II day at the office is that you are spending most of your time 
delegating, training, preparing a board presentation, making one phone call, and having a productive 
lunch. By taking a long-term PC approach, hopefully in a matter of a few weeks, perhaps months, you 
won't face such a Quadrant I scheduling problem again. 

As you go through this analysis, you may bethinking this approach seems idealistic. You may be 
wondering if Quadrant II managers ever work in Quadrant I. I admit it is idealistic. This book is not 
about the habits of highly ineffective people; it's about habits of highly effective people. And to be 
highly effective is an ideal to work toward. 

Of course you'll need to spend time in Quadrant I. Even the best-laid plans in Quadrant II 
sometimes aren't realized. But Quadrant I can be significantly reduced into more manageable 
proportions so that you're not always into the stressful crisis atmosphere that negatively affects your 
judgment as wel I as your health. 

Undoubtedly it will take considerable patience and persistence, and you may not be able to take a 
Quadrant II approach to all or even most of these items at this time. But if you can begi n to make some 
headway on a few of them and help create more of a Quadrant II mind-set in other people as well as 
yourself, then downstream there will be quantum improvements in performance. 

Again, I acknowledge that in a family setting or a small business setting, such delegation may not be 
possible. But this does not preclude a Quadrant II mind-set which would produce interesting and 
creative ways within your Circle of Influence to reduce the size of Quadrant I crises through the 
exercise of Quad rant 11 initiative.
